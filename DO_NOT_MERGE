	This branch is not ready to be merged into master, so
	we are forcing it to fail for Jenkin's sake.  When devel-Jenkins
	is fixed so it doesn't merge branches with names like "*-test"
	then this kludge can be removed.

	This branch is not merged because the x86-64 semantics feature
	is not ready to release yet. [Robb Matzke, 2014-03-09]
