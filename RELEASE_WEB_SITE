Hi,
    ROSE is now distributed publicly from the www.roseCompiler.org
web site.  There you will find the source code version of ROSE
containing a binary of the EDG work (used within ROSE) for a 
number of different platforms.  The installation
directions are maintained at the web site (one of the links).

Thanks,
Dan
