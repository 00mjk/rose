Hi,
   Here is ROSE 0.9.0a, the current version of the manual, tutorial, and
HTML documentation is pre-built for you in the docs/Rose directory.
The README should get you started.

A couple of details, this version requires you to:
     1) have "." in your path (though it should work without this).
     2) have the g++ version 3.3.x or higher compiler in your path (named "g++")
     3) Build the compile tree in a different location than your source tree.
        (if you have problems consider using an absolute path with running configure)

If you have followed steps 1-3 above, then sufficient steps to configure, build, 
and install ROSE are:

  1) ../ROSE-0.9.0a/configure --with-edg_source_code=true
          Note that "--prefix="<install path> is optional and the
          default is now the build tree (new for ROSE-0.8.9a).
  2) make
  3) make check
  4) make install
  5) make installcheck

If you have recieved a version of ROSE containing binaries of the front-end
then please use (this will become the more typical form of distribution in 
the future):

  1) ../ROSE-0.9.0a/configure
          Note that "--prefix="<install path> is optional and the
          default is now the build tree (new for ROSE-0.8.9a).
  2) make
  3) make check
  4) make install
  5) make installcheck

If you received split files (because your email would not accept large files)
then I have likely used a command like:
     split --bytes=10m ROSE-0.9.0a.tar.gz ROSE-0.9.0a.tar.gz.
In which case you should reassemble the files using the command:
     cat ROSE-0.9.0a.tar.gz.a[a-c] > ROSE-0.9.0a.tar.gz

NOTES:

1) Users of ROSE should find the following free software useful
but not required for using ROSE:

   dot version 1.12 (Sun Aug 15 02:43:07 UTC 2004)
      (dot is free software that also called GraphViz,
      and it useful for building graphs of the AST).
   zgrviewer is an open source viewer for dot graphs.
   Adobe Acrobat is free and useful for the pdf 
      representation of the AST.


Thanks,
Dan
