Directions for using roseFreshTest to set up periodic regression tests:

1. Get an account on the machine you are going to run the tests on.
2. Get a scratch directory (normally /export/0/tmp.<your username>) on that
   machine.
3. Copy (using svn cp) a stub script (scripts/roseFreshTestStub-*) to one
   with your name.
4. Edit your new stub script as appropriate:
  a. Set the versions of the different tools you want to use (compiler,
     ...).
  b. Change ROSE_TOP to be in your scratch directory.
  c. Set ROSE_SVNROOT to be the URL of the trunk or branch you want to
     test.
  d. Set MAILADDRS to the people you want to be sent messages about the
     progress and results of your test.
  e. MAKEFLAGS should be set for most peoples' needs, but the -j setting
     might need to be modified if you have a slower or faster computer.
  f. If you would like the copy of ROSE that you test to be checked out
     using "svn checkout" (rather than the default of "svn export"), add a
     line "SVNOP=checkout" to the stub file.
  g. The default mode of roseFreshTest is to use the most current version
     of ROSE on your branch as the one to test.  If you would like to test
     a previous version, you can set SVNVERSIONOPTION to the revision
     specification to use (one of the arguments to -r in "svn help
     checkout").
5. Check your stub script in so that it will be backed up, and so that other
   people can copy from it or update it to match (infrequent) changes in the
   underlying scripts.
6. Run "crontab -e" on the machine you will be testing on:
  a. Make sure there is a line with "MAILTO=<your email>".
  b. Add new lines for each test you would like to run:
    i. If other people are using the machine you are running tests on, be
       sure to coordinate the time your scripts are going to run with them.
    ii. See "man crontab" for the format of the time and date specification.
    iii. The command to use is (all one line):
           cd <your ROSE source tree>/scripts && \
           ./roseFreshTest ./roseFreshTestStub-<your stub name>.sh \
           <extra configure options>
         Where <extra configure options> are things like
         --enable-edg_union_struct_debugging, --with-C_DEBUG=...,
         --with-java, etc.
7. Your tests should then run on the times and dates specified.
8. If you would ever like to run a test immediately, copy and paste the
   correct line in "crontab -e" and set the time to the next minute (note
   that the minute comes first, and the hour is in 24-hour format); ensure
   the date specification includes today's date.  Be sure to quit your
   editor -- just suspending it prevents your changes from taking effect.
