The "rosegit" scripts are what's left over from the days that ROSE
used a combination of Subversion and Git. What's left here are some
shell scripts that are still useful, namely:

rosegit-env       -- sets up the shell environment for doing
                     development work on ROSE. Provides a portable way
                     to specify configuration settings. Allows
                     ROSE executables to be run and debugged directly
                     from a build directory without having to first
                     install them.

rosegit-configure -- Runs the "build" and "configure" scripts without
                     having to change directories first.

rosegit-src       -- Emits the name of the source directory that
                     corresponds to the current working directory
                     in the build tree.

rosegit-filter-make-error
                  -- Reads gmake output and prints only the portion
                     that's relative to an error.

rosegit-functions.sh
                  -- Can be sourced into your shell to define a
                     variety of functions that are useful during
                     development.
