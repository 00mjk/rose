# These instruction semantics tests are *very* sensitive to changes to the Disassembler and Partitioner classes
# because they and this test all use the instruction semantics. If the Disassembler or Partitioner is even slightly
# changed, it could make a different number of calls to the instruction semantics, which changes the sequence number
# used to generate constant names. Therefore, when comparing the test output with the expected answer, we will renumber
# all constant names sequentially. These tests are still sensitive to minor formatting changes in unparseInstruction().
