# The format of this configuration file is a binary file name, followed by a colon, followed the
# names of all the tests that should be run. The test names are defined in th testSampleBinaries.sh
# shell script.
#
# The binary file name can be either the full path, a partial path (full path with the first argument
# of testSampleBinaries.sh removed), just the file name, or the symbol '*'. They are searched in that
# order and the first entry that's found is the one that's used. If no entry is found then a built-in
# list of default tests are run (at this time, the default list is just the test "skip", which always
# succeeds).
