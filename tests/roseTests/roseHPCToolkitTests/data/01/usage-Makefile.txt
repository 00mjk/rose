usage: make <action_1> [<action_2> ...]

Valid <action_k> values include:

*  @TARGET@

Build the program, '@TARGET@'.

*  struct

Run the HPCToolkit utility hpcstruct to recover and build the static structure of the @TARGET@ program binary 
in the form of an xml file: @OUT_STRUCT@


*  profile

Run the HPCToolkit utility hpcstruct to recover and build the static structure of the @TARGET@ program binary 
in the form of an xml file: @OUT_STRUCT@
For each of these PAPI_[xxx] events, @COUNTERS@, run the following HPCToolkit analyis tools on the @TARGET@ program: 
(1) hpcrun producing performance measurements to be analyzed by hpcprof
(2) hpcprof to analyze call path profile performance measurements and attribute them to static source code structure
(3) hpcdata.sh to generate the corresponding flat xml profile file:  @OUT_PROFILE@/PAPI_[xxx].xml

*  analysis

Run the following HPCToolkit analysis tools on the @TARGET@ program: 
(1) hpcstruct to recover and build the static structure of the program binary 
    in the form of an xml file:  @OUT_STRUCT@
(2) hpcrun on all PAPI_[xxx] events in @COUNTERS@, producing performance measurements to be analyzed by hpcprof
(3) hpcprof to analyze call path profile performance measurements and attribute them to static source code structure
(4) hpcdata.sh to generate the corresponding flat xml profile file:  @OUT_ALL_EVENTS@

* all

make @TARGET@ struct profile analysis
