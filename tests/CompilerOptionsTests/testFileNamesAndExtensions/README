#################################################################################
There were a couple of problems with ROSE handling filenames. The aim of this work
is to resolve some of them and highlight some of the rest.
#################################################################################
The files/directories in this directory highlight some of the problems that 
ROSE-frontend has in handling input files.

The directory has two perl scripts

   test_filenames.pl : for relatively simple cases, like 
      what if the input file is inexistent? 
      what if one of the input file(s) is inexistent?
      what if the input is a directory?
      given in each of the absolute and relative files

   test_filenames_looong_torture.pl: this file has more wierd cases, ones that try 
      to break the system, if we are dependedent on the UNIX variable PATH_MAX or 
      not.

and two directories
    SUFFIX_TESTS: that tests ROSE identity translator, gcc, g++ for file name extensions.
    The directory has its own readme
    These are handled reasonably done now

    META_CHARS: that tests ROSE identity translator with files. 
****NOTE**** These  are still not properly done now.

Open questions or known extensions:
(Dan and I had some discussions on these. Could not come to a proper conclusion.)

  1. Should we enforce rules on the names of output files?  
     Should it have the same extension? Why? Why not?

  2. We are not doing a good job of handling filenames with UNIX meta 
     characters.  #, $, ', ` space, so on and so forth.  They should be handled
     more carefully.
    
  3. Related to 2, we should carefully list if we are making any system calls
     and fix if they violate any security issues. 
     Example: we should replace all "system" calls by proper "exec"s
