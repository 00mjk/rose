! This test code for the include mechanism still fails becuase OFP does
! not provide any information about where the include mechnaism is used
! in the code.  I desperately need a c_action function to be called!

! include file using double quoted string
include "test2007_46_a.h"

! include file using single quoted string
include 'test2007_46_b.h'

end
