Fortran Tests fail with certain libraries enabled.
Libraries in question are:
    - boost iostream
    - libraries added when building with qt

Laksono has sent email with three bugs in ROSE.
Zung has provided ROSE bugs on my USB stick.
Craig will send some ROSE bugs in a tarball via email (much later in the year)).

Types will be changed to include a Fortran specific data member in 
SgType to hold the kind parameter when it is specified (NULL is not).
This data member will be a SgExpression*

We will modify SgImpliedDo to have a SgScopeStatement* data member.
This will store the "j=1" as a variable declaration with the scope to
be one created and stored in the SgImpliedDo expression.  This is
the first case of a scope being held by an expression.
