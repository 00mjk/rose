\page ProjectPublications ROSE Project Publications

This page contains some of the research papers associated with the 
ROSE project over the last several years.  For numerous reasons, we feel 
that the latest papers are the best papers, this is likely typical
of any ambitious project; but we have included everything for
completeness.  It is hoped that the underlying goal within each paper
of supporting the use of high-level abstractions will be clear together with
our attempts to address the performance issues required for the use of 
high-level abstractions within scientific computing.  A selectedpapers.bib 
is included (ROSE/ROSE_ResearchPapers/selectedpapers.bib) to make it easy 
to reference the latest papers.

\section LabelA Brief descriptions of the several papers that we have included
<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/LCPC2004-OptimizationsOfObjectOrientedAbstractionsThroughClassificationOfSemantics.pdf"> 
     LCPC2004-OptimizationsOfObjectOrientedAbstractionsThroughClassificationOfSemantics.pdf </a>. \n
     This paper outlines an approach to the optimization of user-defined abstractions.
     This work represents a substantial goal for ROSE and an initial work by us on the
     general subject of how to write code an a very high level of abstraction and have the 
     lower level code required to get good performance be automatically generated.

<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/ISOLA2004-ClassificationAndUtilizationOfAbstractionsForOptimization.ps"> 
     ISOLA2004-ClassificationAndUtilizationOfAbstractionsForOptimization.ps </a>. \n
     This paper is a general introduction to recent work in the ROSE project.

<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/Vienna2006-AutomatedTuning.pdf">
     Vienna2006-AutomatedTuning.pdf </a>. \n
     This represent some recent work on empirical optimization (not yet published).
     this entry should likely be removed until it is published.

<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/ICS05BrianWhiteAndCast.pdf"> ICS05BrianWhiteAndCast.pdf </a>. \n
     This paper is about the optimization of unstructured grid applications and represent
     preparatory work for future automated transformations specific to unstructured grid
     applications within DOE using ROSE.

<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/LCPC2004-OptimizationsOfObjectOrientedAbstractionsThroughClassificationOfSemantics.pdf"> 
     LCPC2004-OptimizationsOfObjectOrientedAbstractionsThroughClassificationOfSemantics.pdf </a>. \n
     This paper covers the details of optimizing object-oriented abstractions using ROSE.
     Unfortunately, ROSE is not mentioned anywhere in the paper, a ridiculous oversight,
     but oh well.  The subject is the optimization, not the ROSE compiler infrastructure.

<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/JMLC2003-RoseArchitecture.ps"> JMLC2003-RoseArchitecture.ps </a>. \n
    This paper covers the architecture of ROSE as a project.  It is one of the best
    and most up to date papers on ROSE.

<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/LCPC03-ParallelOptimizationOfContainers.ps"> 
     LCPC03-ParallelOptimizationOfContainers.ps </a>. \n
     This paper is the informal proceedings version and demonstrates the optimization 
     of generalized container abstractions and
     is related to Active Library research (or so I understand).  It is also related to 
     Telescoping Language research.  The paper demonstrates a few of the newest features 
     in ROSE and has served an an introduction for the authors into the optimization of 
     the STL library more generally.

<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/WOMPAT2003-OpenMPTranslation.ps"> WOMPAT2003-OpenMPTranslation.ps </a>. \n
    This paper demonstrates the use of ROSE to recognize OpenMP pragmas and, using the
    Nanos OpenMP runtime library, build a subset of an OpenMP specific compiler for C++.

<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/HIPS2001-LibrariesAsDomainSpecificLanguages.ps"> 
     HIPS2001-LibrariesAsDomainSpecificLanguages.ps </a>. \n
     This paper is specific to compile-time optimization of array classes.  It demonstrates
     what was at the time the most current work on the compile-time optimization of an
     array class library.  ROSE is more general, but this paper is very specific to
     the optimization of a single library.

<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/CPC2000-SupportForObjectOrientedFrameworks.ps"> 
     CPC2000-SupportForObjectOrientedFrameworks.ps </a>. \n
     This paper was an introduction to the work being done at the time on ROSE complete
     with a more detailed motivation for compile-time optimization of specific libraries.

<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/CPC2001-Concurrency2003.ps"> CPC2001-Concurrency2003.ps </a>. \n
    This is one of the first papers on ROSE presented at CPC2001 and later updated for
    publication into the Journal of Concurrency, Practice, and Experience.

<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/LCPC2001-SpecificationOfTransformations.ps"> 
     LCPC2001-SpecificationOfTransformations.ps </a>. \n
     This was a paper which specified some elements of what later became the string based
     AST rewrite mechanism used in ROSE.

<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/PDPTA2001-ROSETTA.ps"> PDPTA2001-ROSETTA.ps </a>. \n
    This paper describes the development of a tool, ROSETTA, which build object-oriented
    Intermediate Representations (IRs) for compilers.  It is a tool used within ROSE to
    build the SAGE III IR which we use internally with the EDG front-end.  It is specific
    to details of the internal ROSE compiler infrastructure.

<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/SCI1999-OptimizingArrayClassLibraries.ps"> SCI1999-OptimizingArrayClassLibraries.ps </a>. \n
    This paper present preliminary work on the compile-time optimization of array 
    class libraries.


<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/IPPS1997-ExpressionTemplatePerformanceIssues.ps"> 
     IPPS1997-ExpressionTemplatePerformanceIssues.ps </a>. \n
     Discusses the different approaches to the
     optimization of array class libraries.  Optimization of array class libraries led 
     to the development of ROSE as a project, though ROSE is not at all specific to array 
     class libraries and addresses the optimization of libraries generally.  This paper
     can be helpful in understanding what work was done using language template 
     features within C++ before attempting to address the optimization issues more
     generally at compile time. Prior work started on ROSE had been abandoned because 
     of the perceived significant advantages of template meta-programming techniques
     for scientific computing.  Several papers on the details of template use were 
     written, this is the most complete of them.  It is included with these papers to
     provide a bit of perspective (currently historical).
