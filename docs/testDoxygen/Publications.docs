 *  
 * This page contains some of the research papers associated with the ROSE project over the last several years.  For numerous
 * reasons, we feel that the latest papers are the best papers, this is likely typical of any ambitious project; but we have
 * included everything for completeness.  It is hoped that the underlying goal within each paper of supporting the use of
 * high-level abstractions will be clear together with our attempts to address the performance issues required for the use of
 * high-level abstractions within scientific computing.

 *   of OpenMP Programs Using Hybrid Program Analysis", submitted to ICPP'12, The 41st International Conference on Parallel
 *   Processing, Pittsburgh, PA, September 10-13, 2012.
 *   
 *   This paper presents a novel technique to detect data races and deadlocks of OpenMP programs, using hybrid program
 *   analysis. Specifically, we use an SMT-solver based static analysis to analyze OpenMP source code. Then we use a dynamic
 *   analysis to confirm, or rule out, the potential errors. The static analysis narrows down the code regions and events that
 *   need to be monitored, significantly reducing the overhead of the dynamic analysis. Our experiments show that
 *   OpenMP-Checker is more scalable and accurate at pinpointing concurrency errors within a set of chosen benchmarks, compared
 *   to the two commercial tools, Sun Thread Analyzer and Intel Thread Checker.

 *   Boston, June 25-28, 2012.
 *
 *   This paper presents a compiler based transformation released in ROSE and demonstrates the use of Triple Modular Redundancy
 *   as an approach to provide HPC software with fault tolerance against transient faults, as we expect them to manifest
 *   themselves on future Exascale architectures.  The paper presents performance results showing that for a randomly selected
 *   subset of benchmarks the overhead of this extra layer of support is about 20%.  We expect that may be competitive with
 *   future approaches to fault tolerance using check-point restart that may be much more expensive or maybe even intractable
 *   for Exascale.  This work is released as a framework within ROSE to support research work in this area by ourselves and
 *   collaborators.

 *   International Workshop on OpenMP, IWOMP 2012, Rome, June 11-13, 2012.
 *
 *   This paper presents an auto-scoping algorithm to work with OpenMP tasks. (Auto-scoping is the process of automatically
 *   determining the data sharing dependencies of variables in OpenMP programs). This is a much more complex challenge due to
 *   the uncertainty of when a task will be executed, which makes it harder to determine what parts of the program will run
 *   concurrently. We also introduce an implementation of the algorithm and results with several benchmarks showing that the
 *   algorithm is able to correctly scope a large percentage of the variables appearing in them.

 *   (CF'12)](http://www.computingfrontiers.org/2012), May 15th-17th, 2012, Cagliari, Italy.
 *
 *   This paper presents an extensive study of the impact of application level optimizations on both the performance and power
 *   efficiencies of applications from a wide range of scientific and embedded systems domains. We observe that
 *   application-level optimizations often have a much larger impact on performance than on power consumption. However,
 *   optimizing for performance does not necessarily lead to better power consumption, and vice versa. Compared to sequential
 *   applications, multithreaded applications give more room for performance and power improvements. Additionally, a number of
 *   optimizations, including loop and thread affinity optimizations, have shown great potential in supporting collective
 *   enhancement of both performance and power efficiency. Our experimental results provide several insights to help exploit
 *   these optimizations effectively.

 *   This paper describes our work of using ROSE to build an effective source-to-source outliner in order to support whole

 *   set of more manageable kernel tuning tasks. In particular, the outliner can generate kernels which preserve performance
 *   characteristics of tuning targets which can be easily handled by other tools. This work also demonstrates how one can use
