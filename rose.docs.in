 * @section introduction Introduction
 * 
 *  ROSE is a tool for building source-to-source translators (sometimes confused with a preprocessor which is generally less
 *  sophisticated internally).  ROSE is particularly useful in building custom tools that operate on source code for C, C99,
 *  C++, F77, F90, and F2003. Fortran support is currently in development as a result of collaboration with Los Alamos National
 *  Laboratory to use their version of the Open Fortran Parser (OFP).  Our use of ROSE is focused on the development of
 *  optimizing source-to-source tools to support development of large scale scientific applications (applications typically
 *  about one million lines of code in size).
 * 
 * @section documentation Supporting documentation
 * 
 *  You are reading Doxygen generated documentation that serves as the primary reference for the ROSE API, among other things.
 *  Other forms of documentation:
 * 
 * @subsection website Web site
 * 
 *  The [ROSE Web Site](http://www.rosecompiler.org) is the main location to get more information about the ROSE project. Built
 *  in 2005, it has been slow to evolve since we wanted to keep a low profile as long as possible while we focused on
 *  robustness issues within the ROSE project and infrastructure.
 * 
 * @subsection user_manual User manual
 *
 *  The [ROSE User Manual](http://www.rosecompiler.org/ROSE_UserManual/ROSE-@VERSION@-UserManual.pdf) presents how to get
 *  started with ROSE and documents features of the ROSE infrastructure. It can also be found in the docs/Rose
 *  directory. Postscript and PDF versions can be generated from the TeX source.
 * 
 * @subsection tutorial Tutorial
 *
 *  The [ROSE Tutorial](http://www.rosecompiler.org/ROSE_Tutorial/ROSE-@VERSION@-Tutorial.pdf) presents a collection of
 *  examples using ROSE and can be found in the "tutorial" directory of the ROSE source tree.  Users can play with the examples
 *  and run them.
 *
 *  The tutorial documentaton is built in the following steps:
 *
 *  + actual source code for each example translator in the "tutorial" directory is included into the tutorial documentation.
 *  + each example is compiled
 *  + inputs to the examples are also in the "tutorial" directory.
 *  + output from each example is placed into the tutorial documentation.
 * 
 * @subsection email_list Email lists
 *
 *  We have three mailing lists:
 *
 *  + [rose-core](https://mailman.nersc.gov/mailman/listinfo/rose-core) is for those who have write access to our internal
 *    repository.
 *
 *  + [rose-developer](https://mailman.nersc.gov/mailman/listinfo/rose-developer) is for everyone who contributes source code
 *    to the ROSE project.
 *
 *  + [rose-public](https://mailman.mersc.gov/mailman/listinfo/rose-public) is for anyone that uses ROSE.
 * 
 * @subsection publications Publications
 *
 *  ROSE is a research project which emphasises publication about the new technologies that we are developing, often as part of
 *  external collaborations.  Publications specific to the ROSE project can be found at the main ROSE web page as [project
 *  publications](http://rosecompiler.org/ROSE_HTML_Reference/ProjectPublications.html) and [project
 *  talks](http://rosecompiler.org/ROSE_HTML_Reference/ProjectTalks.html).
 * 
 * @section download_instructions Download instructions
 * 
 *  ROSE is an open source project available at [github](https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose) and
 *  [rosecompiler.org](http://rosecompiler.org). */
