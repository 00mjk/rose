                          DESCRIPTION
                          -----------

The Open Fortran Parser (OFP) project provides a Fortran 2003 compliant
parser and associated tools.  The tools provide a Java and C API for
actions that are called when parser rules are completed.  These actions
allows a parser consumer to build a custom AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).

The OFP parser is based on an ANTLR 3 grammar and ANTLR tools are used
to generate the Fortran parser (written in Java).  The C action
interfaces are currently provided by JNI.

                            RESOURCES
                            ---------

Installation instructions:

  - See the INSTALL file in the top OFP directory (./INSTALL).

Documentation:

  - Still a little sparse.  Action interfaces are defined by the Java file
    ./src/fortran/ofp/parser/java/IFortranParserAction.java.

Running parser:

  - You must set your java CLASSPATH to include the ANTLR jar files and 
    OpenFortranParser.jar.  If you use the bash shell, you can set the
    CLASSPATH with something like (assuming files are installed in /usr/local):

    export CLASSPATH=./:/usr/local/antlr-3.0.1/antlr-3.0.1.jar:/usr/local/antlr-3.0.1/stringtemplate-3.0.jar:/usr/local/antlr-3.0.1/antlr-2.7.7.jar:/usr/local/ofp/lib/OpenFortranParser.jar

  - Run the parser with the command

         java fortran.ofp.FrontEnd [--dump] filename

Help:

  - Please send e-mail to crasmussen@lanl.gov.

CVS Repository:

  - The public is free to check out the most recent copy of the OFP CVS
    repository and experiment with the tools.  Any patches or changes that
    you wish to have added should be sent to crasmussen@lanl.gov. 
    Information regarding CVS checkout can be found off of the sourceforge
    web page:
