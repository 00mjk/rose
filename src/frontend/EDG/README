ROSE uses EDG as a front-end to parsing C and C++.  We then read 
the EDG AST to generate the AST in ROSE using the Sage III IR.

We currently use version 3.3 of EDG, and although this has been
robust and feature rich, we have some reasons for wanting to
upgrade to later versions of EDG.

We use EDG mostly as is, and make only minor changes:
   1) Adding pointers to Sage III IR nodes to some structs in EDG (see il_def.h)
   2) We add the work to save literals as strings in the Sage III IR.

We need a more complete list, some of what has been modified in 3.3 is no longer required
in versions after 3.7.
