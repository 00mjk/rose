/** Partitions instructions into basic blocks and functions.
 *
 *  The Partitioner classes are responsible for partitioning the set of instructions previously disassembled by a Disassembler
 *  class into AST nodes for basic blocks (SgAsmBlock) and functions (SgAsmFunctionDeclaration).  A basic block is a contiguous
 *  sequence of nonoverlapping instructions where control flow enters at only the first instruction and exits at only the last
 *  instruction. A function is a collection of basic blocks with a single entry point. In the final ROSE AST, each instruction
 *  belongs to exactly one basic block, and each basic block belongs to exactly one function.
 *
 *  The partitioner organizes instructions into basic blocks by starting at a particular instruction and then looking at its
 *  set of successor addresses. Successor addresses are edges of the eventual control-flow graph (CFG) that are calculated
 *  using instruction semantics, and are available to the end user via SgAsmBlock::get_cached_successors().  It's not always
 *  possible to statically determine the complete set of successors; in this case, get_cached_successors() will return only the
 *  statically known successors and SgAsmBlock::get_complete_successors() will return false.  Because ROSE performs semantic
 *  analysis over all instructions of the basic block (and occassionally related blocks), it can sometimes determine that
 *  instructions that are usually considered to be conditional branches are, in fact, unconditional (e.g., a PUSH followed by a
 *  RET; or a CALL to a block that discards the return address).  ROSE includes unconditional branch instructions and their
 *  targets within the same basic block (provided no other CFG edge comes into the middle of the block).
 *
 *  The partitioner organizes basic blocks into functions in three phases, all three of which can be run by a single call
 *  to the partitioner() method. The first phase considers all disassembled instructions and other available information such as
 *  symbol tables and tries to determine which addresses are entry points for functions.  For instance, if the symbol table
 *  contains function symbols, then the address stored in the symbol table is assumed to be the entry point of a function.  ROSE
 *  has a variety of these "pre-cfg" detection methods which can be enabled/disabled at runtime with the set_search() method.
 *  ROSE also supports user-defined search methods that can be registered with add_function_detector().  The three phases are
 *  initialized and influenced by the contents of an optional configuration file specified with the set_config() method.
 *
 *  The second phase for assigning blocks to functions is via analysis of the control-flow graph.  In a nutshell, ROSE
 *  traverses the CFG starting with the entry address of each function, adding blocks to the function as it goes. When it
 *  detects that a block has edges coming in from two different functions, it creates a new function whose entry point is that
 *  block (see definition of "function" above; a function can only have one entry point).
 *
 *  The third and final phase, called "post-cfg", makes final adjustments, such as adding SgAsmFunctionDeclaration objects for
 *  no-op or zero padding occuring between the previously detected functions. This could also be user-extended to add blocks to
 *  functions that ROSE detected during CFG analysis (such as unreferenced basic blocks, no-ops, etc. that occur within the
 *  extent of a function.)
 *
 *  By default, ROSE constructs a Partitioner to use for partitioning instructions of binary files during frontend() parsing
 *  (this happens in Disassembler::disassembleInterpretation()).  This Partitioner's settings are controlled by two
 *  command-line switches whose documentation can be seen by running any ROSE program with the --help switch.  These
 *  command-line switches operate by setting property values in the SgFile node and then transferring them to the Partitioner
 *  when the Partitioner is constructed.
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>-rose:partitioner_search initializes the detection methods by calling set_search(), and parse_switches()</li>
 *    <li>-rose:partitioner_config specifies an IPD file by calling set_config().</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  The results of block and function detection are stored in the Partitioner object itself. One usually retrieves this
 *  information via a call to the build_ast() method, which constructs a ROSE AST.  Any instructions that were not assigned to
 *  blocks of a function can be optionally discarded (see the SgAsmFunctionDeclaration::FUNC_LEFTOVERS bit of set_search(), or
 *  the "leftovers" parameter of the "-rose:partitioner_search" command-line switch).
 *
 *  The Partitioner class can easily be subclassed by the user. Some of the Disassembler methods automatically call
 *  Partitioner::partition(), using either a temporarily instantiated Partitioner, or a partitioner provided by the user.
 *
 *  NOTE: Some of the methods used by the partitioner are more complex than one might originally imagine.  The CFG analysis,
 *  for instance, must contend with the fact that the graph nodes (basic blocks) are changing as new edges are discovered
 *  (e.g., splitting a large block when we discover an edge coming into the middle). Changes to the nodes result in
 *  changes to the edges (e.g., a PUSH/RET pair is an unconditional branch to a known target, but if the block were to be
 *  divided then the RET becomes a branch to an unknown address (i.e., the edge disappears).
 *  
 *  Another complexity is that the CFG analysis must avoid circular logic. Consider the following instructions:
 *  \code
 *     1: PUSH 2
 *     2: NOP
 *     3: RET
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  When all three instructions are in the same basic block, as they are initially, the RET is an unconditional branch to the
 *  NOP. This splits the block and the RET no longer has known successors (according to block semantic analysis).  So the edge
 *  from the RET to the NOP disappears and the three instructions would coalesce back into a single basic block.  In this
 *  situation, ROSE keeps these three instructions as two basic blocks with no CFG edges to the second block.
 *
 *  A third complexity is that the Partitioner cannot rely on the usual ROSE AST traversal mechanisms because it must perform
 *  its work before the AST is created.  However, the Partitioner benefits from this situation by being able to use data
 *  structures and methods that are optimized for performance.
 *
 *  A final complexity, is that the Disassembler and Partitioner classes are both designed to be useful in a general way, and
 *  independent of each other.  These two classes can be called even when the user doesn't have an AST.  For instance, the
 *  tests/roseTests/binaryTests/disassembleBuffer.C is an example of how the Disassembler and Partitioner classes can be used
 *  to disassemble and partition a buffer of instructions obtained outside of ROSE's binary file parsing mechanisms.

     *                                   IPD Parser for initializing the Partitioner
     *************************************************************************************************************************/
public:

    /** This is the parser for the instruction partitioning data (IPD) files.  These files are text-based descriptions of the
     *  functions and basic blocks used by the partitioner and allow the user to seed the partitioner with additional information
     *  that is not otherwise available to the partitioner.
     *
     *  For instance, the analyst may know that a function begins at a certain virtual address but for some reason the partitioner
     *  does not discover this address in its normal mode of operation.  The analyst can create an IPD file that describes the
     *  function so that the Partitioning process finds the function.
     *
     *  An IPD file is able to:
     *  <ul>
     *    <li>specify an entry address of a function that is otherwise not detected.</li>
     *    <li>give a name to a function that doesn't have one.</li>
     *    <li>specify whether the function ever returns to the caller.</li>
     *    <li>list additional basic blocks that appear in the function.</li>
     *    <li>specify the address of a basic block that is otherwise not detected.</li>
     *    <li>indicate that a basic block is semantically equivalent to another basic block.</li>
     *    <li>override the control-flow successors for a basic block.</li>
     *  </ul>
     *
     *  The language non-terminals are:
     *  \code
     *     File := Declaration+
     *     Declaration := FuncDecl | BlockDecl
     *
     *     FuncDecl := 'function' Address [Name] [FuncBody]
     *     FuncBody := '{' FuncStmtList '}'
     *     FuncStmtList := FuncStmt [';' FuncStmtList]
     *     FuncStmt := ( Empty | BlockDecl | ReturnSpec )
     *     ReturnSpec := 'return' | 'returns' | 'noreturn'
     *
     *     BlockDecl := 'block' Address Integer [BlockBody]
     *     BlockBody := '{' BlockStmtList '}'
     *     BlockStmtList := BlockStmt [';' BlockStmtList]
     *     BlockStmt := ( Empty | Alias | Successors ) ';'
     *     Alias := 'alias' Address
     *     Successors := ('successor' | 'successors') [SuccessorAddrList]
     *     SuccessorAddrList := AddressList | AddressList '...' | '...'
     *
     *     AddressList := Address ( ',' AddressList )*
     *     Address: Integer
     *     Integer: DECIMAL_INTEGER | OCTAL_INTEGER | HEXADECIMAL_INTEGER
     *     Name: STRING
     *  \endcode
     *
     *  Language terminals:
     *  \code
     *     HEXADECIMAL_INTEGER: as in C, for example: 0x08045fe2
     *     OCTAL_INTEGER: as in C, for example, 0775
     *     DECIMAL_INTEGER: as in C, for example, 1234
     *     STRING: double quoted. Use backslash to escape embedded double quotes
     *  \endcode
     *
     *  Comments begin with a hash ('#') and continue to the end of the line.  The hash character is not treated specially inside
     *  quoted strings.
     *
     *  Semantics
     *
     *  A block declaration specifies the virtual memory address of the block's first instruction. The integer after the
     *  address specifies the number of instructions in the block.  If the specified length is less than the number of
     *  instructions that ROSE would otherwise place in the block at that address, then ROSE will create a block of exactly
     *  the specified size. Likewise, if the specified address is midway into a block that ROSE would otherwise create, ROSE
     *  will create a block at the specified address anyway, causing the previous instructions to be in a separate
     *  block (or blocks).  If the specified block size is larger than what ROSE would otherwise place in the block, the block
     *  will be created with fewer instructions but the BlockBody will be ignored.
     *
     *  A function declaration specifies the virtual memory address of the entry point of a function. The body may specify
     *  whether the function returns. As of this writing [2010-05-13] a function declarated as non-returning will be marked as
     *  returning if ROSE discovers that a basic block of the function returns.
     *
     *  If a block declaration appears inside a function declaration, then ROSE will assign the block to the function.
     *
     *  The block 'alias' attribute is used to indicate that two basic blocks perform the exact same operation.  The specified
     *  address is the address of the basic block to use instead of this basic block.  All control-flow edges pointing to this
     *  block will be rewritten to point to the specified address instead.
     *
     *  Example file:
     *  \code
     *     function 0x805116 "func11" {             # declare a new function named "func11"
     *         returns;                             # this function returns to callers
     *         block 0x805116 {                     # block at 0x805116 is part of func11
     *             alias 0x8052116, 0x8052126       # use block 0x805116 in place of 0x8052116 and 0x8052126
     *         }
     *     }
     *  \endcode
     *
     *  Example usage: The easiest way to parse an IPD file is to read it into memory and then call the parse() method.  The
     *  following code demonstrates the use of mmap to read the file into memory, parse it, and release it from memory.  For
     *  simplicity, we do not check for errors in this example.
     *  \code
     *    Partitioner p;
     *    int fd = open("test.ipd", O_RDONLY);
     *    struct stat sb;
     *    fstat(fd, &sb);
     *    const char *content = (char*)mmap(NULL, sb.st_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
     *    Partitioner::IPDParser(p, content, sb.st_size).parse();
     *    munmap(content, sb.st_size);
     *  \endcode
