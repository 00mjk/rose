/** Defines registers available for a particular architecture.
 *
 *  The dictionary maps each register name to a RegisterDescriptor.  The RegisterDescriptor describes how a register name maps
 *  to (part of) a physical CPU register by providing a major number, minor number, bit offset, and number of bits.  The major
 *  number is typically a register class number and the minor number is typically an offset within the class.  For instance,
 *  for x86 the major numbers might indicate whether a register is a general purpose register, an 80-bit floating point
 *  register, a 128-bit MMX register, etc.
 *
 *  Users should not assume that the values of a RegisterDescriptor correspond to actual values found in the machine
 *  instructions that were disassembled.  What they can assume is that two unrelated registers (such as "eax" and "ebx") do not
 *  overlap in the RegisterDescriptor address space (major, minor, offset, size). They can also assume that two related
 *  registers (such as "eax" and "rax", the 32- and 64-bit versions of a single CPU register) do, in fact, overlap in the
 *  RegisterDescriptor address space and that the overlap indicates how the registers are related.
 *
 *  Users should not assume that RegisterDescriptor entries from two separate dictionaries are compatible. Looking up the "eax"
 *  register in one dictionary may return a different descriptor than "eax" looked up in a different dictionary.  Components of
 *  the ROSE binary support that generate RegisterDescriptors will provide a mechanism for obtaining (and possibly setting) the
 *  register dictionary.  For instance, the Disassembler class has get_registers() and set_registers() methods. */
