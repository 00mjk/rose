/** Virtual base class for instruction disassemblers.
 *
 *  The Disassembler class is a virtual class providing all non-architecture-specific functionality for the recursive
 *  disassembly of instructions; architecture-specific components are in subclasses such as DisassemblerArm,
 *  DisassemblerPowerpc, and DisassemblerX86. In general, there is no need to explicitly instantiate or call functions in any
 *  of these subclasses.
 *
 *  All details of the instructions, and the operands and operator expression trees, etc. are stored in the binary AST as
 *  separate IR nodes.  The SgAsmInstruction class and its architecture-specific subclasses represent individual instructions.
 *  The arguments for those instructions are represented by the SgAsmExpression class and subclasses thereof.
 *
 *  Disassembly normally happens automatically unless the -rose:read_executable_file_format_only switch is specified.
 *  Alternatively, this Disassembler class can be used to explicitly disassemble parts of a file. The Disassembler class
 *  handles all non-architecture-specific details of disassembly, such as where to search for instructions in the address
 *  space and how instructions are concatenated into basic blocks.  The Disassembler has a pure virtual method,
 *  disassembleOne(), that is implemented by architecture-specific subclasses and whose purpose is to disassemble one
 *  instruction.
 *
 *  New architectures can be added to ROSE without modifying any ROSE source code. One does this by subclassing Disassembler
 *  and providing an implementation for the virtual can_disassemble() method.  An instance of the new class is registered with
 *  ROSE by calling the Disassembler's register_subclass() class method. When ROSE needs to disassemble something, it calls the
 *  can_disassemble() methods for all known disassemblers, and the first one that returns a new disassembler object will be
 *  used for the disassembly.  Class derivation can also be used to influence various disassembler settings--see the example
 *  below.
 *
 *  If an error occurs during the disassembly of a single instruction, the disassembler will throw an exception. When
 *  disassembling multiple instructions the exceptions are saved in a map, by virtual address, and the map is returned to the
 *  caller along with the instructions that were successfully disassembled.
 *
 *  The main interface to the disassembler is the disassembleBuffer() method. It searches for instructions based on the
 *  heuristics specified in the set_search() method, reading instruction bytes from a supplied buffer.  A MemoryMap object is
 *  supplied in order to specify a mapping from virtual address space to offsets in the supplied buffer. The
 *  disassembleBuffer() method is used by methods that disassemble whole sections, whole interpretations, or whole files; in
 *  turn, it calls disassembleBlock() which disassembles sequential instructions until a control flow branch is encountered.
 *
 *  A MemoryMap object can be built that describes the entire virtual address space and how it relates to offsets in the
 *  executable file.  This object, together with the entire contents of the file, can be passed to the disassembleBuffer()
 *  method in order to disassemble the entire executable in one call.  However, if the executable contains multiple
 *  independent interpretations (like a PE file that contains a Windows executable and a DOS executable) then the best
 *  practice is to disassemble each interpretation individually.  The disassemble() method is convenient for this.
 *
 *  While the main purpose of the Disassembler class is to disassemble instructions, it also needs to be able to group those
 *  instructions into basic blocks (SgAsmBlock) and functions (SgAsmFunctionDeclaration). It uses an instance of the
 *  Partitioner class to do so.  The user can supply a partitioner to the disassembler or have the disassembler create a
 *  default partitioner on the fly.  The user is also free to call the partitioner directly on the InstructionMap object
 *  returned by most of the disassembler methods.
 *
 *  For example, the following code disassembles every single possible address of all bytes that are part of an executable
 *  ELF Segment but which are not defined as any other known part of the file (not a table, ELF Section, header, etc.). By
 *  building a map and making a single disassembly call, we're able to handle instructions that span segments, where the bytes
 *  of the instruction are not contiguous in the file.
 *
 *  @code
 *  SgAsmGenericHeader *header = ....; // the ELF file header
 *
 *  // Create a memory map
 *  Loader *loader = Loader::find_loader(header);
 *  MemoryMap *map = loader->map_executable_sections(header);
 *
 *  // Disassemble everything defined by the memory map
 *  Disassembler *d = Disassembler::create(header);
 *  d->set_search(Disassembler::SEARCH_ALLBYTES); // disassemble at every address
 *  Disassembler::AddressSet worklist; // can be empty due to SEARCH_ALLBYTES
 *  Disassembler::InstructionMap insns;
 *  insns = d->disassembleBuffer(map, worklist);
 *
 *  // Print all instructions
 *  Disassembler::InstructionMap::iterator ii;
 *  for (ii=insns.begin(); ii!=insns.end(); ++ii)
 *      std::cout <<unparseInstructionWithAddress(ii->second) <<std::endl;
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The following example shows how one can influence how ROSE disassembles instructions. Let's say you have a problem with
 *  the way ROSE is partitioning instructions into functions: it's applying the instruction pattern detector too aggressively
 *  when disassembling x86 programs, so you want to turn it off.  Here's how you would do that. First, create a subclass of
 *  the Disassembler you want to influence.  All the work is in the can_disassemble() method.
 *
 *  @code
 *  class MyDisassembler: public DisassemblerX86 {
 *  public:
 *      virtual Disassembler *can_disassemble(SgAsmGenericHeader *hdr) const {
 *          Disassembler *d = DisassemblerX86::can_disassemble(hdr);
 *          if (!d) return NULL;
 *          delete d;
 *          Partitioner *p = new Partitioner;
 *          unsigned h = p->get_heuristics();
 *          h &= ~SgAsmFunctionDeclaration::FUNC_PATTERN;
 *          p->set_heuristics(h);
 *          d = new MyDisassembler;
 *          d->set_partitioner(p);
 *          return d;
 *      }
 *  };
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Then the new class is registered with ROSE:
 *
 *  @code
 *  Disassembler::register_subclass(new MyDisassembler);
 *  @endcode
