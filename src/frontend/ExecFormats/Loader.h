/** This class is the interface for binary file loaders.
 *
 *  A Loader is reponsible for constructing a MemoryMap describing a
 *  mapping from virtual memory to file content and emulates the actions taken by real-world loaders. Each real-world loader
 *  will be represented as a subclass of Loader. The loaders are registered with ROSE by calling register_loader(), making
 *  them available to modules such as the instruction disassembler.
 *
 *  For example, given a Windows PE executable containing a DOS executable and a PE executable, this is how one would create a
 *  mapping to describe all the code-containing sections that are part of the PE executable:
 *
 *  @code
 *  SgAsmPEFileHeader *pe_header = ...;
 *  Loader *loader = Loader::find_loader(pe_header); // Get the best loader for PE
 *  MemoryMap *map = loader->map_code_sections(pe_header);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The high-level functions, map_all_sections(), map_code_sections(), map_executable_sections(), map_writable_sections(), and
 *  possibly others in the future each have three overloaded versions: one that selects sections from the entire file, one
 *  that selects sections belonging to a particular binary header, and one that selects sections from a specified list.  These
 *  are all declared virtual so that a subclass can provide new definitions, although normally only the last version (the one
 *  that takes a list of sections) is overridden since the other two are defined in terms of it.
 *
 *  The high-level functions then call create_map(), supplying a local class using the Selector interface to describe which
 *  specific sections contribute to the final mapping and how they contribute.  The sections are sorted (see order_sections())
 *  and then each contributing section is then run through the align_values() method to satisfy alignment constraints, choose
 *  new virtual addresses, and/or eliminate the section from consideration.
 *
 *  Finally, once values are aligned addresses are added to or removed from the MemoryMap that is eventually returned.  For
 *  each section that is added to the memory map, the section's starting address is assigned with
 *  SgAsmGenericSection::set_mapped_actual_rva().

    /** Computes memory mapping addresses for a section.
     *
     *  Operating systems generally have some alignment constraints for how a file is mapped to virtual memory, and these
     *  correspond to the page size. For example, see the man page for Unix mmap().  There are three parts to the information
     *  returned:
     *
     *  First, we need to know the entire range of file offsets that are mapped. On Unix systems only entire pages of a file
     *  can be mapped. If the section begins with a partial page then we align the starting offset downward. Likewise if the
     *  section ends with a partial page we extend the range.  Both of these adjustments can increase the number of file bytes
     *  that are mapped.  The starting offset and file size are returned through the @p offset and @p file_size arguments.
     *
     *  Second, we need to know the entire range of virtual addresses that are affected.  Again, at least on Unix systems,
     *  only entire pages of memory can be mapped. We therefore make the same adjustments to memory as we did to the file,
     *  aligning the starting virtual address downward and the ending address upward. Both of these adjustments can affect the
     *  size of the virtual address region affected.  The starting address and memory size are returned through the @p va and
     *  @p mem_size arguments.  When the returned memory size is larger than the returned file size then the mapping will
     *  include an anonymous region (memory that is initialized to zero rather than file contents).
     *
     *  Finally, we need to indicate where the first byte of the section is located in memory. If we needed to make
     *  adjustments to the first affected virtual address then the start-of-section will not be the same as the first affected
     *  virtual address.  The start-of-section virtual address is the return value of this function.
     *
     *  Additionally, this function can veto a section mapping by returning a zero memory size.  This can happen when the
     *  Selector selects a section indiscriminantly (as with map_all_sections()) but there is not enough information to
     *  determine where the section should be mapped.  On the other hand, it can also define a mapping for a section that
     *  doesn't have any mapping attributes (for instance, the ELF object file loader, LoaderELFObj, maps function text
     *  sections that are marked as "not mapped" in the ELF container by choosing free regions of virtual memory using the @p
     *  current argument that contains the most up-to-date mapping). */

     *  create_map() before sections are passed through the Selector object.  The default implementation excludes any section
