How I got ROSE to work on my Mac
--------------------------------

Environment:
   MacBook Pro 15" Core i5 & 4 GB RAM running Mac OS X 10.6.4
   ROSE trunk revision 831

The following steps were necessary to get ROSE to build without errors:

1. Needed libtoolize.
	=> installed libtools 2.2.8 in /usr/local.

2. Needed boost.
	=> installed boost 1.43.0 in custom location.

3. Found three bugs in <ROSE>/build.
	-- fixed & submitted to Dan.

4. Needed wget.
	=> installed wget 1.9.1 in /usr/local.

5. Warning during configure from "libltdl/configure" about ROSEy options.
	=> ignored for now

6. At src/frontend/Disassemblers/AssemblerX86.C:1768, 'tmpnam_r' was not declared.
	=> replaced with std 'tmpnam'.

7. At src/frontend/Disassemblers/AssemblerX86.C:1777 & 1824, 'TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY'
   was not declared. (Sometimes found in ??). Added the following to that file:

	#ifndef TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY
	#define TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY(expression) \
	(__extension__	 \
	({ long int __result;	 \
	do __result = (long int) (expression);	 \
	while (__result == -1L && errno == EINTR);	 \
	__result; }))
	#endif

8. Ditto(8) for src/frontend/BinaryFormats/MemoryMap.C.

9. Build ok until late step testing whether can link against ROSE: "dyld: Library not loaded".
	=> in Mac OS X, set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, not LD_LIBRARY_PATH
