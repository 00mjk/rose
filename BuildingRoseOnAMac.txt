1. Install MacPorts (http://www.macports.org)

	This step is easy if you have administrator privileges. Just download the
	precompiled package from the MacPorts website.
	
	Here are directions for installing MacPorts without administrator privileges:
	
	-You will have to compile MacPorts from source. Download the source
	
	-Configure MacPorts so that it doesn't require root privileges. For example,
	
		./configure --prefix=/Users/$USER/macports --with-no-root-privileges --with-install-user=$USER --with-install-group=rose
		
	-"make" and "make install" MacPorts

2. Add the MacPorts binary path to the *front* of your path. 
	For this guide, we assume MacPorts is installed under 
	/Users/$USER/macports. In this case, the path of the binaries is
	/Users/$USER/macports/bin

3. Run "port -v selfupdate"
	If you are on LLNL campus, you first need to open your firewall before doing this
	step. You can do so at https://cspservices.llnl.gov
	
4. Install the ports necessary for ROSE to compile. 
	
	git-core
	wget
	graphviz
	libtool
	doxygen
	texlive
	texlive-latex-extra
	boost
	gcc44
	ld64

	Recommended ports:
	ccache
	graphviz-gui
	
	To install the ports, the command is "port install <package names>". Multiple
	packages can be installed at once, for example "port install git-core wget graphviz"
	
5.	Link libtool to glibtool

	ln -s /Users/$USER/macports/bin/glibtool /Users/$USER/macports/bin/libtool
	ln -s /Users/$USER/macports/bin/glibtoolize/Users/$USER/macports/bin/libtoolize
	
6. Verify that the right version of libtool is getting called by running
	"which libtool" and "which libtoolize"

7. Configure ROSE as follows. (Make sure to run the build script beforehand if necessary)
	
	../configure --with-CXX_DEBUG=-ggdb3 --with-CXX_WARNINGS=-Wall --with-boost=/Users/$USER/macports  --with-gfortran=/Users/$USER/macports/bin/gfortran-mp-4.4 --with-alternate_backend_fortran_compiler=gfortran-mp-4.4 GFORTRAN_PATH=/Users/$USER/macports/bin/gfortran-mp-4.4
