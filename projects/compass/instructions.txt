commands to update the compass directory using the compassRepository:

  1) From ROSE/projects/compass directory:
          compassRepository/bin/compass_submission_setup.sh compassRepository `pwd`

     Note that this will overwite any existing checkers in the ROSE/projects/compass
     directory.

  2) If changes are made to the files in the ROSE/projects/compass directory, then
     these changes can be saved back into the ROSE/projects/compass/compassRepository
     (or where ever the compassRepository is located).  The command to do this is:
        make archiveExplicitCharSign
     (this example shows it's use for the "ExplicitCharSign" test, each test should be
     run seperately).  This feature address the rare but practical circumstance where
     changes to ROSE for changes to a few of the checkers and we want to save the changes
     in to a new set of distributable checker tarballs.
