Description of this directory
-----------------------------
compass_template_generator has a couple of source files and a 
generator script gen_checker.sh.

Invocation of the script gen_checker.sh
---------------------------------------
The style-checker-writer (you!) would invoke the script gen_checker.sh with 
the functionality of the desired project. The script generates the directory
and the code templates that you can use to build the style-checkers from.

Example
-------
Suppose you want to build a style-checker with functionality
"multiple cases on same line", you invoke the gen_checker script 
in the following way:

   $ gen_checker.sh multiple cases on same line

Some notes about the generated sources:

1. A new directory named 'multipleCasesOnSameLine' is created with the 
   following files:

         compass.C
         compass.h
         compass_parameters
         compassTestMain.C
         Makefile
         Makefile.am
         multipleCasesOnSameLine.C
         multipleCasesOnSameLineDocs.tex
         multipleCasesOnSameLine.h
         multipleCasesOnSameLineMain.C
         multipleCasesOnSameLineTest1.C

   Some of the files (compass.[Ch], compass_parameters and
   compass_parameters) are copied from the current directory, while the
   others (multiple*, Makefile, Makefile.am) are generated.
  
2. The class/namespace names have prefixes
   'MultipleCasesOnSameLine'.

3. The ifdef-guard is named 'COMPASS_MULTIPLE_CASES_ON_SAME_LINE_H'

4. The project description will be "Multiple Cases On Same Line".

Some suggestions:
-----------------

1. It is advised that you do not invoke the script gen_checker with words
   like checker, detector, tester, etc. Adding these verbs at the command
   line means that these words are added as suffixes into the
   directory-name. Which will make it redundant, as the compass project is
   about writing style-checkers!

2. Some of the files have read-only permissions and are intended only for
   such use. Please do not change the permissions of these files.

Enjoy your style-traversals!
