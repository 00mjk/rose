Installing Aterm Library:
   The ATerm library is required within Stratego.
There is a patch to Aterm-2.8 (so likely this is the
best version to use).  Note that even without the
patch there is a bug in the installation of Stragego 
that only happens (for me) if you run make clean and
try to rerun make. It is:
   Making all in test
   ../utils/dicttoc -file-prefix terms -dict terms.dict
   gmake[1]: *** [terms.c] Segmentation fault
   gmake: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
   tux321.llnl.gov{dquinlan}6: 
However, if you install a freash version and only
run:
   configure --prefix=`pwd`
   patch patch -p1 < aterm.patch
   make
   make install

NOTE: this assumes that you have copied the aterm.patch that 
is required for use of aterms with stratego into the top level
aterm-2.8 directory.

ROSE must then be configured to use the Aterm library.
    --with-aterm

To avoid the bug in the rebuilding we can edit the test/Makefile.in 
(at the bottom) to be:

.dict.c:
#  Edited out to avoid rebuiding error.
#	${top_builddir}/utils/dicttoc -file-prefix $* -dict $<
	touch terms.c
	touch terms.h

Note that editing the Makefile.am file has no effect since it
in not possible to rerun automake (strange version error with 
aclocal.m4).
