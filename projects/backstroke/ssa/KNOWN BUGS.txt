BUGS
----

-For post-increment ops, such as i++, the uses are incorrectly matched to the post-increment op. Instead, uses should be matched
   to the definition that comes before the increment.

-Dead code is not handled correctly. Uses of a variable inside dead code result in an assertion that there is a use
   with no reaching definitions.

-In interprocedural analysis, recursion is not yet handled

-The analysis repeatedly traverses the virtual CFG, instead of building a static CFG up front. While this does not impact
   correctness, it is a serious performance detriment


TODO (in addition to fixing the above bugs)
-----

-Add more query functions

-Add a classification for expanded defs, as either expanded from prefix or expanded from a member

-Add a method to allow analyzing a single function
