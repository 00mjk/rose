BUGS
----

-Bodies of catch statements are not analyzed. This is a shortcoming of the ROSE virtual CFG (to be fixed by Michael)

-Variables used to define the dimensions inside an array declaration are not detected as uses

-The analysis repeatedly traverses the virtual CFG, instead of building a static CFG up front. While this does not impact
   correctness, it is a serious performance detriment

-Operands of the sizeof operator are considered uses, and t hey should not be.
