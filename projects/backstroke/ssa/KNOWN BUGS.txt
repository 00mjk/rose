BUGS
----

-SERIOUS INTERPROCEDURAL BUG: Interprocedural definitions are P-defs, or possible definitions, rather than D-defs (definite
	definitions. As such, they should not (always) kill the previous reaching definition!

-For post-increment ops, such as i++, the uses are incorrectly matched to the post-increment op. Instead, uses should be matched
   to the definition that comes before the increment.

-Bodies of catch statements are not analyzed. This is a shortcoming of the ROSE virtual CFG (to be fixed by Michael)

-Variables used to define the dimensions inside an array declaration are not detected as uses

-Dead code is not handled correctly. Uses of a variable inside dead code result in an assertion that there is a use
   with no reaching definitions.

-The analysis repeatedly traverses the virtual CFG, instead of building a static CFG up front. While this does not impact
   correctness, it is a serious performance detriment


TODO (in addition to fixing the above bugs)
-----

-Add more query functions

-Add a classification for expanded defs, as either expanded from prefix or expanded from a member

-Add a method to allow analyzing a single function
