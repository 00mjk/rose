The "ExtractFunctionArguments" normalization ensures that all
function arguments are either variables or constant inputs.

It has the following limitations
1. continue is not supported in loops. This is because certain
   temporary variable creation, such as for incrementing, is
   inserted at the end of loop bodies. Such code must always be executed

2. User-supplied classes and structures must have side-effect free
   copy constructors that create correct copies. This is because
   storing the value result of a function call to pass it to another 
   function necessarily involves calling the copy constructor once
   more than it would be normally called.
