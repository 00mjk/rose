README for Bug Seeding Project

Note that the dot graph layouts can be improved by 
eliminating the SgFile and __binaryFile__null
and the associated edges.

"0x2a98fa0010"[label="0:423\nSgFile\n2\n0x2a98fa0010\n" ];
"0x2a98fa0010" -> "0x2a98fdb010"[label="root" dir=both ];
"0x2a98fa0010" -> "0x2a98fa0010__binaryFile__null"[label="binaryFile" dir=none ];
"0x2a98fa0010__binaryFile__null"[label="" shape=diamond ];


Maybe we could have an attribute which can turn off these nodes in the DOT graph?
this could be implemetned to introduce "//" to comment out the line in the dot file
so that it coudl be editied manually as part of debugging.
