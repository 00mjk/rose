Project goal:
   The goal of the BinaryContextLookup-tool is to provide the means to identify functions
and their context from debug information (filename and line-number) in the binary. In the
first step a database is build by the bcl_writer using roses front- and midend. In step
two the reader provides line and context lookup functionality. For this step Rose is not
necessary anymore.

   The tool uses input of file and line-number to find the current function and all
possible functions calling that function. Either the reader can be used as a interactive
query-style lookup-tool or in a streamed pip to identify path and line-numbers.

 Examples are provided to demonstrate a possible use of this tool. Use `make test` to
demonstrate possible use.

Building:
 This tool depends on the libxml2-library which must be ready to be used. Use 
`xml2-config --version` to check if libxml is installed and if it meets the version
requirements of at least 2.5.10 (earlier versions might work, but have not been tested).

 If you have not initially used the --with-libxml2 option on the configure command-line for
ROSE to activate project, please rerun configure using this option with your other options.

   Some documentation is written in the source files.
