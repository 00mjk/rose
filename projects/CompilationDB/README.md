Compilation Databases
=====================

Tools and examples using CLANG-style Compilation Databases. There is two tools:
 * scripts/comp\_db\_map.py: which applies a "tool" to each of the compilation units in the database and save the results in a JSON report
 * scripts/comp\_db\_render.py: which generates an HTML document from the JSON report

Both scripts usage are documented using "--help".

These script are not specific to ROSE. Any tool can be used.

## Examples

We demonstrate these tools with two cases:
 * examples/demo: simply demonstrate the usage on empty files
 * examples/kripke: demonstrate applying testTranslator and rajaChecker

### Kripke example

In the case of Kripke, we demonstrate building two versions of the Compilation DB: sequential configuration and OpenMP configuration.

## TODOs

### Distributed systems

Can we improve scripts/comp\_db\_map.py so that it can use capacity clusters at the lab?

### Complex Output

I would like to be able to generate report that integrate graph generated using GraphViz or any other kind of output generated by the tool.

### ROSE plugins

Look into ROSE's plugin mechanism and see if it needs anything special...
