/*
 * NAME
 *	uname03.c
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	uname03 - call uname() and make sure it succeeds
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	loop if that option was specified
 *	issue the system call
 *	check the errno value
 *	  issue a PASS message if we get zero
 *	otherwise, the tests fails
 *	  issue a FAIL message
 *	  break any remaining tests
 *	  call cleanup
 *
 * USAGE:  <for command-line>
 *  uname03 [-c n] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-p x] [-t]
 *	where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *		-f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *		-i n : Execute test n times.
 *		-I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *		-P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *		-t   : Turn on syscall timing.
 *
 * History
 *	07/2001 John George
 *		-Ported
 *
 * Restrictions
 *	none
