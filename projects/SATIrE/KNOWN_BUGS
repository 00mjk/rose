In some rare cases the original AST is modifyied when generating the
ICFG: 
the reason seems to be a bug in ROSE 0.8.10e's deep copy mechanism which
we use when generating the SATIrE-ICFG from the ROSE-AST. This deep
copy mechanism is already fixed for the next ROSE release. We will
need to investigate this problem again, once the new release is
available.
Problem caused: some file info is missing and an assert fails.
