Version 0.7.0

BUG: options --sourceoutput and --textoutput

     The output is always correct for callstring length 0.
     
     But if the callstring length is greater 0, not all data may be
     printed, because only one data item is shown for each node.
     The data attached to the AST is complete, but the print function 
     is not finished yet.
     
     [will be fixed in next release]
