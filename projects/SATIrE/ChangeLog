V0.8.3 (in progress)

* Better support for combined analyses
  - correct prefixing of SATIrE support functions

* New PAG analysis support features
  - TypeId as abstract type identifier
  - experimental side-effecting add_tmpvarid support function

* Termite: [AP]
  - Changed all occurrences of PrologString to PrologAtom
    (all names in the term representation are now 'singlequoted')

V0.8.2 2008-06-02 GB,MS,AP

* required user changes:
  - change analysis specifications to take the new ExternalReturn statement
    into account
  - change analysis specifications to take into account that the numexprs
    and numtypes attributes are now of type unum instead of snum; all
    support functions related to expression and type numbers now take unum
    rather than snum; also, there is a new support function varsym_varid (see
    file docs/satire_attributes_auxiliary_functions)
  - for existing analyses, call newanalysis or manually change
    main-support.C (according to the template) to reflect a change in the
    interface of the CFGTraversal class

* recommended user changes:
  - change analysis specifications to use the new ExpressionId and
    VariableId instead of str. Note that the gdl file generation automatically
    displays the string representation of the mapped IDs. You can use the
    new command line options to display the IDs as well.
        
* new command line options [GB,MS]
  --check-icfg: Command line flag to control ICFG consistency checks
  --gdl-nodeformat=FORMAT: allows to specify how node information should be
                           displayed in a gdl file.
                           FORMAT=varid|varname|exprid|exprsource
                                 |asttext|no-varid|no-varname
                                 |no-exprid|no-exprsource|no-asttext
  --input-binary-ast=FILE/--output-binary-ast=FILE: support for ROSE's
    binary AST I/O mechanism which can be a little faster than building the
    AST from source code

* New PAG analysis specification features [GB]
  - replaced single ExternalCall node by ExternalCall/ExternalReturn pair
  - added attribute  ROUTINE procnum: snum #  to access the number of the
    current procedure from PAG analyses
  - introduced experimental VariableId type that can be used in analysis
    specifications, see docs/satire_attributes_auxiliary_functions; using
    integral identifiers for variables/expressions/types is expected to be
    deprecated at some point

* ICFG builder improvements [GB]
  - no longer removing unreachable ICFG nodes because that may hinder
    correct annotation of the program
  - replaced slow expression numbering mechanism by Mihai Ghete's faster AST
    hashing
  - fixed ICFG builder failures related to default constructor arguments
  - some refactoring and dramatic improvements in method lookup
  - reintroduced UndeclareStmts which had somehow gone missing
  - improved the handling of node lists for PAG analyses, the new way doesn't
    leak memory anymore

* Testsuite improvements [GB]
  - separate histograms are generated for execution time and memory usage
  - GNUplot input files remain on disk and can be tweaked by the user

* Reorganized Testsuite [AP]
  - added separate directories for different bechnmark suites

* Example analyses [GB,MS]
  - added experimental avalable expressions analysis [not in distribution]
  - changed constprop to use variable IDs; expression numbering must be
    enabled!
  - changed sl1rd and sl2rd to use VariableId instead of str.

* Build system improvements [GB]
  - fixed autoconf warnings by introducing <satire_rose.h>
  - everything is now compiled with the -Werror flag, so code that produces
    warnings is forbidden
  - suppressed (but did not fix!) warnings for code generated by PAG


V0.8.1 2008-04-11 GB,AP,VP,MS

* Combined PAG analyses [GB]
  - added experimental script 'newcombinedanalysis' to generate directories
    and support files for combining PAG analyses

  - added analyzer command line flag --no-number-expressions to turn off
    expression numbering for analyses that don't need it
  - replaced most const char * strings by std::string
  - removed memory leaks

* required user changes:
  - change analysis specifications to support AssignInitializer/AggregateInitializer nodes
  - change command line options according to new options (see 'youranalyzer --help')
  - you must apply command 'newanalysis' without option '-u' to regenerate main.C

* Changed and added command line options [MS]
  - names of output files for source,term,gdl can now be specified
  - options for specifying naming conventions for multiple output files

* Added support for multiple input and multiple output files [MS]
  - multiple input files are represented in one single AST

        srw98_shape/main.C: PAG_BOOL get_universal_attribute__kill_norm_temps()
        nnh99_shape/main.C: PAG_BOOL get_universal_attribute__kill_norm_temps()
        nnh99_shape/main.C: PAG_BOOL get_universal_attribute__kill_empty_graph()
        nnh99_shape/main.C: PAG_BOOL get_universal_attribute__kill_unreachable_nodes()
  - changed Makefile.in-template to use CUSTOM_CFLAGS for main.C and main-support.C
    allowing to eliminate all redeclaration warnings
        
* upgrade to ROSE 0.9.0b [MS,GB,AP]
  - extended IR interface [MS]
    + added fragmentToString function and made it the only function to create
      string representations of AST subtrees in SATIrE [MS]
    + improved performance of unparseToString (eliminated deep copy of AST fragments) [MS]
  - upgraded handling of variable names to ROSE 0.9.0b and improved handling of scopes [MS]
  - upgraded ICFG generation with new type information of ROSE 0.9.0b and adapted use of 
    unparseToString functions [GB]
  - upgraded termite to work with ROSE 0.9.0b: [AP]
        + generate symbol table entries for function declarations
        + generate symbol table entries for class declarations
        + parent scopes for namespace declarations are not necessary any more
        + because of some printf statements in the new ROSE code,
          term2rose and rose2term no longer read/write from/to stdin/out
        
* Termite: 
 - improved term quoting [AP]
 - new lex/yacc parser for PAG data flow information dfi_[parser|scanner] [AP]
        
        
* Tested with:
 - ROSE 0.9.0b
 - PAG 7.3.8.55
 - flex 2.5.33
 - bison 2.3
 - g++ 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)

        
V0.7.8 2008-01-24 AP, GB, VP, MS

* Added Makefile.custom to shape analyses to allow customized
  settings in Makfile [MS,VP]
        
* Updated docs/cfgconstruction.ps for DeclareStmt, ExternalCall, 
  FunctionEntry, FunctionExit, FunctionCall, FunctionReturn [MS]

* Added graph visualization for srw98_shape and nnh99_shape.
  The gdl files now show the shape graphs for each node.
  For the srw98 analysis a single graph is shown for each node.
  For the nnh99 analysis a set of graphs is shown for each node.
  (the summary graph shows the union of the set of graphs)
  [VP,MS]

* Post-processing of may/must analysis information:
  Open issues: 
    - For must-alias pair computation of the SRW98 analysis
      we assume that existing edges do not represent null values.
      This will be fixed in one of the next releases.
    - One kind of may-aliases is not reported yet: access paths
      that lead to an unshared summary node, but do share a common
      node on their path.
  [VP]
        
* Term Representation: 
  Support for more data types (StringVal, ...) [AP]
  Various bugfixes

* Term Representation: Added a compiletime-switch
  -DCOMPACT_TERM_REPRESENTATION wich changes the external term
  representation to a more convenient format. [AP]

* Added a global attribute and some auxiliary functions for access to global
  variables from PAG analysis specifications. [GB]

* Added file docs/satire_attributes_auxiliary_functions as documentation of
  all attributes and auxiliary functions provided by SATIrE. [GB]

* Tested with:
 - ROSE 0.8.10e
 - PAG 6.1.6.96
 - flex 2.5.33
 - bison 2.3
 - g++ 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)

 - PAG 6.1.6.96
 - flex 2.5.33
 - bison 2.3
 - g++ 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)

        
V0.7.6 2007-10-23 GB, MS, AP

* required user changes:
  - change analysis specifications that match on the ExternalCall constructor

* Added the function expression and the parameter list to the ExternalCall
  constructor. [GB]
* Improved ICFG construction for logical expressions; the result assigned to
  the logical variable is now always a boolean constant. Right-associative
  expressions like a || (b && c) are still evaluated in a wrong order,
  however. [GB]
* Added the -rpath linker flag in several makefiles to encode the path to
  the ROSE libraries in binaries we generate. This should make use of the
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable unnecessary. [GB]

* Changed skeleton files such that generated analyzers 
  now operate on all source code that is included with directives 
  (e.g. header files, included C++ files, etc.) [MS]

* Fixed newanalysis to operate without parameters [MS]

* Fixed termite to handle missing file infos [AP]

* Tested with:

          newanalysis [analysis-directory-name] [carrier-type-name]
        
* reworked entire build system to use GNU autotools
* added Termite: src/termite
* analysis results are exported to term representation

 - PAG 6.1.6.96
 - flex 2.5.33
 - bison 2.3
 - g++ 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)


V0.7.4 2007-07-15 MS

* required user changes:
  - Modify optla file(s): remove ExpressionRoot( ) 
  - Rerun newanalysis (skeleton files were modified)

* Adapted SATIrE interfaces from ROSE 0.8.8a to ROSE 0.8.10e
  - rewrote analyzer/icfgbuilder
    + rewrote the icfg generation to use one uniform interface
    + added new SATIrE-ROSE interfacing class Ir
    + changed code to use new ROSE-AST features
    + changed code to comply with strict ROSE 0.8.10e AST checks

    + eliminated the use of SgRootExpression
    + changed code to create and access new IR structure 
  - upgraded analyzer/annotation code to gcc 4.1.1+

 - PAG 6.1.6.96
 - flex 2.5.33
 - bison 2.3
 - g++ 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)


V0.7.3 2007-05-22 MS

* required user changes: none

* Added support for specific C versions
  new command line options:
    --language c++
    --language c89
    --language c99

* Tested with:
  - ROSE 0.8.8a (requires g++ 3.3-5.x)
  - PAG 0.9.7.843d
  - flex 2.5.31
  - bison 1.875d
  - g++ 3.5.5
        

V0.7.2 2007-05-10 MS,GB

* required user changes: none

* Added support for syntactic lists in PAG specifications [GB]
* Changed --prefix=syn to -Psyn in grato/Makefile [MS]
* Fixed problem with file "other.h" (added to src/analyzer/astaccess) [MS]
        
* Tested with:
  - ROSE 0.8.8a (requires g++ 3.3-5.x)
  - PAG 0.9.7.843d
  - flex 2.5.31
  - bison 1.875d
  - g++ 3.5.5
        

V0.7.1 2007-03-20 MS

* required user changes: none

* Changed main.C-template to not compile generated C/C++ files
* Changed all example-analyses in directory examples. Now only files *.set,
        *.optla, and 'runtests' are in the directory and all other files are
        generated by invoking 'newanalysis' for each analysis example. Each
        of the example-analysis directories can now be copied verbatim and
        appear like an user-defined analysis. However, after 'make' in
        directory examples all required files are generated and after
        'make clean' all generated files are removed. Thus, the examples
        can be run within the distribution package or outside after
        copying one of the directories (with files *.set, *.optla, runtests)
* Fixed src/analyzer/astaccess/Makefile (to set variable PIG)
* Added ast_support_funcs.h (with new headers for support functions)
        main.h-template was modified to include above file

* Tested with:
  - ROSE 0.8.8a (requires g++ 3.3-5.x)
  - PAG 0.9.7.843d
  - flex 2.5.31
  - bison 1.875d
