V0.7.9 2008 MS,GB

* upgrade to PAG 7.3.8.55 [MS]
  - added new functions kfg_routine_is_loop and kfg_routine_is_infeasible
    to file astaccess/pag_support.C (thanks to AbsInt for detailed info on new PAG version)
  - changed type bool to PAG_BOOL in
	srw98_shape/main.C: PAG_BOOL get_universal_attribute__kill_norm_temps()
	nnh99_shape/main.C: PAG_BOOL get_universal_attribute__kill_norm_temps()
	nnh99_shape/main.C: PAG_BOOL get_universal_attribute__kill_empty_graph()
	nnh99_shape/main.C: PAG_BOOL get_universal_attribute__kill_unreachable_nodes()
  - changed Makefile.in-template to use CUSTOM_CFLAGS for main.C and main-support.C
    allowing to eliminate all redeclaration warnings
	
* upgrade to ROSE 0.9.0b [MS,GB,AP]
  - extended IR interface [MS]
    + added fragmentToString function and made it the only function to create
      string representations of AST subtrees in SATIrE [MS]
    + improved performance of unparseToString (eliminated deep copy of AST fragments) [MS]
  - upgraded handling of variable names to ROSE 0.9.0b and improved handling of scopes [MS]
  - upgraded ICFG generation with new type information of ROSE 0.9.0b and adapted use of 
    unparseToString functions [GB]
  - upgraded termite to work with ROSE 0.9.0b: [AP]
	+ now generate symbol table entries for function declarations
	+ parent scopes for namespace declarations are not necessary any more
	+ because of some printf statements in the new ROSE code,
	term2rose and rose2term no longer read/write from/to stdin/out
	
* Termite: improved term quoting [AP]
	
* Tested with:
 - ROSE 0.9.0b
 - PAG 7.3.8.55
 - flex 2.5.33
 - bison 2.3
 - g++ 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)

	
V0.7.8 2008-01-24 AP, GB, VP, MS

* Added Makefile.custom to shape analyses to allow customized
  settings in Makfile [MS,VP]
	
* Updated docs/cfgconstruction.ps for DeclareStmt, ExternalCall, 
  FunctionEntry, FunctionExit, FunctionCall, FunctionReturn [MS]

* Added graph visualization for srw98_shape and nnh99_shape.
  The gdl files now show the shape graphs for each node.
  For the srw98 analysis a single graph is shown for each node.
  For the nnh99 analysis a set of graphs is shown for each node.
  (the summary graph shows the union of the set of graphs)
  [VP,MS]

* Post-processing of may/must analysis information:
  Open issues: 
    - For must-alias pair computation of the SRW98 analysis
      we assume that existing edges do not represent null values.
      This will be fixed in one of the next releases.
    - One kind of may-aliases is not reported yet: access paths
      that lead to an unshared summary node, but do share a common
      node on their path.
  [VP]
	
* Term Representation: 
  Support for more data types (StringVal, ...) [AP]
  Various bugfixes

* Term Representation: Added a compiletime-switch
  -DCOMPACT_TERM_REPRESENTATION wich changes the external term
  representation to a more convenient format. [AP]

* Added a global attribute and some auxiliary functions for access to global
  variables from PAG analysis specifications. [GB]

* Added file docs/satire_attributes_auxiliary_functions as documentation of
  all attributes and auxiliary functions provided by SATIrE. [GB]

* Tested with:
 - ROSE 0.8.10e
 - PAG 6.1.6.96
 - flex 2.5.33
 - bison 2.3
 - g++ 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)

	
V0.7.7 2007-11-12 VP, AP, MS

* added srw98_shape, nnh99_shape [VP,MS]
* extended newanalysis with option -u [AP]
* added --wholeprogram option to the analyzer [AP]
* fixed ./configure checks for ROSE and PAG [AP] (thanks to Michael Tautschnig, TU Munich)

* Tested with:
 - ROSE 0.8.10e
 - PAG 6.1.6.96
 - flex 2.5.33
 - bison 2.3
 - g++ 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)

	
V0.7.6 2007-10-23 GB, MS, AP

* required user changes:
  - change analysis specifications that match on the ExternalCall constructor

* Added the function expression and the parameter list to the ExternalCall
  constructor. [GB]
* Improved ICFG construction for logical expressions; the result assigned to
  the logical variable is now always a boolean constant. Right-associative
  expressions like a || (b && c) are still evaluated in a wrong order,
  however. [GB]
* Added the -rpath linker flag in several makefiles to encode the path to
  the ROSE libraries in binaries we generate. This should make use of the
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable unnecessary. [GB]

* Changed skeleton files such that generated analyzers 
  now operate on all source code that is included with directives 
  (e.g. header files, included C++ files, etc.) [MS]

* Fixed newanalysis to operate without parameters [MS]

* Fixed termite to handle missing file infos [AP]

* Tested with:
 - ROSE 0.8.10e
 - PAG 6.1.6.96
 - flex 2.5.33
 - bison 2.3
 - g++ 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)

    + rewrote the icfg generation to use one uniform interface
    + added new SATIrE-ROSE interfacing class Ir
    + changed code to use new ROSE-AST features

 - bison 2.3
 - g++ 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)


V0.7.3 2007-05-22 MS

* required user changes: none

* Added support for specific C versions
  new command line options:
    --language c++
    --language c89
    --language c99

* Tested with:
  - ROSE 0.8.8a (requires g++ 3.3-5.x)
  - PAG 0.9.7.843d
  - flex 2.5.31
  - bison 1.875d
  - g++ 3.5.5
	

V0.7.2 2007-05-10 MS,GB

* required user changes: none

* Added support for syntactic lists in PAG specifications [GB]
* Changed --prefix=syn to -Psyn in grato/Makefile [MS]
* Fixed problem with file "other.h" (added to src/analyzer/astaccess) [MS]
	
* Tested with:
  - ROSE 0.8.8a (requires g++ 3.3-5.x)
  - PAG 0.9.7.843d
  - flex 2.5.31
  - bison 1.875d
  - g++ 3.5.5
	

V0.7.1 2007-03-20 MS

* required user changes: none

* Changed main.C-template to not compile generated C/C++ files
* Changed all example-analyses in directory examples. Now only files *.set,
	*.optla, and 'runtests' are in the directory and all other files are
	generated by invoking 'newanalysis' for each analysis example. Each
	of the example-analysis directories can now be copied verbatim and
	appear like an user-defined analysis. However, after 'make' in
	directory examples all required files are generated and after
	'make clean' all generated files are removed. Thus, the examples
	can be run within the distribution package or outside after
	copying one of the directories (with files *.set, *.optla, runtests)
* Fixed src/analyzer/astaccess/Makefile (to set variable PIG)
* Added ast_support_funcs.h (with new headers for support functions)
        main.h-template was modified to include above file

* Tested with:
  - ROSE 0.8.8a (requires g++ 3.3-5.x)
  - PAG 0.9.7.843d
  - flex 2.5.31
  - bison 1.875d
  - g++ 3.5.5
