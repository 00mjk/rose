V0.7.x 2007-xx-xx

changed all example-analyses in directory examples. Now only files *.set,
	*.optla, and runtests are in it and all other files are generated by
	invoking newanalysis for each analysis example. Each of the
	example-analyses directories can now copied verbatim and appear like
	an user-defined analysis. However, after 'make' in directory examples
	all required files are generated and after 'make clean' all
	generated files are removed. Thus, the examples can be run within
	the distribution package or outside after copying one of the analyses.
Fixed src/analyzer/astaccess/Makefile (to set variable PIG)
Added ast_support_funcs.h (with new headers for support functions)
      main.h-template is modified to include above file
