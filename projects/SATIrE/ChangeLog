V0.7.4 2007-07-15 MS

* required user changes:
  - Modify optla file(s): remove ExpressionRoot( ) 
  - Rerun newanalysis (skeleton files were modified)

* Adapted SATIrE interfaces from ROSE 0.8.8a to ROSE 0.8.10e
  - rewrote analyzer/icfgbuilder
    + rewrote the icfg generation to use one uniform interface
    + added new SATIrE-ROSE interfacing class Ir
    + changed code to use new ROSE-AST features
    + changed code to comply with strict ROSE 0.8.10e AST checks
  - changed analyzer/astaccess 
    + eliminated the use of SgRootExpression
    + changed code to create and access new IR structure 
  - upgraded analyzer/annotation code to gcc 4.1.1+
  - updated analyzer/skeletons (used by newanalysis)
  - changed examples analyses to not use RootExpression

* Tested with:
 - ROSE 0.8.10e
 - PAG 6.1.6.96
 - flex 2.5.33
 - bison 2.3
 - g++ 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)

V0.7.3 2007-05-22 MS

* required user changes: none

* Added support for specific C versions
  new command line options:
    --language c++
    --language c89
    --language c99

* Tested with:
  - ROSE 0.8.8a (requires g++ 3.3-5.x)
  - PAG 0.9.7.843d
  - flex 2.5.31
  - bison 1.875d
  - g++ 3.5.5
	

V0.7.2 2007-05-10 MS,GB

* required user changes: none

* Added support for syntactic lists in PAG specifications
* Changed --prefix=syn to -Psyn in grato/Makefile
* Fixed problem with file "other.h" (added to src/analyzer/astaccess)
	
* Tested with:
  - ROSE 0.8.8a (requires g++ 3.3-5.x)
  - PAG 0.9.7.843d
  - flex 2.5.31
  - bison 1.875d
  - g++ 3.5.5
	

V0.7.1 2007-03-20 MS

* required user changes: none

* Changed main.C-template to not compile generated C/C++ files
* Changed all example-analyses in directory examples. Now only files *.set,
	*.optla, and 'runtests' are in the directory and all other files are
	generated by invoking 'newanalysis' for each analysis example. Each
	of the example-analysis directories can now be copied verbatim and
	appear like an user-defined analysis. However, after 'make' in
	directory examples all required files are generated and after
	'make clean' all generated files are removed. Thus, the examples
	can be run within the distribution package or outside after
	copying one of the directories (with files *.set, *.optla, runtests)
* Fixed src/analyzer/astaccess/Makefile (to set variable PIG)
* Added ast_support_funcs.h (with new headers for support functions)
        main.h-template was modified to include above file

* Tested with:
  - ROSE 0.8.8a (requires g++ 3.3-5.x)
  - PAG 0.9.7.843d
  - flex 2.5.31
  - bison 1.875d
  - g++ 3.5.5
