V0.7.2 2007-05-xx

  - ROSE 0.8.8a (requires g++ 3.3-5.x)
  - PAG 0.9.7.843d
  - flex 2.5.31
  - bison 1.875d
  - g++ 3.5.5
	
V0.7.1 2007-03-20

* Changed main.C-template to not compile generated C/C++ files
* Changed all example-analyses in directory examples. Now only files *.set,
	*.optla, and 'runtests' are in the directory and all other files are
	generated by invoking 'newanalysis' for each analysis example. Each
	of the example-analysis directories can now be copied verbatim and
	appear like an user-defined analysis. However, after 'make' in
	directory examples all required files are generated and after
	'make clean' all generated files are removed. Thus, the examples
	can be run within the distribution package or outside after
	copying one of the directories (with files *.set, *.optla, runtests)
* Fixed src/analyzer/astaccess/Makefile (to set variable PIG)
* Added ast_support_funcs.h (with new headers for support functions)
        main.h-template was modified to include above file
* Tested with:
  - ROSE 0.8.8a (requires g++ 3.3-5.x)
  - PAG 0.9.7.843d
  - flex 2.5.31
  - bison 1.875d
  - g++ 3.5.5
