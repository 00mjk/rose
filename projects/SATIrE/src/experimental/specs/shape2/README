The subdirectories contain the specs of these shape analysis algorithms:

nnh99/ The analysis described in the book "Principle of Program Analysis"
       (F. Nielson, H.R. Nielson, C. Hankin).

srw98/ The analysis from TOPLAS'98, "Solving shape-analysis problems
       in languages with destructive updating" (M. Sagiv, T. Reps, R. Wilhelm)

What is common between the analyses, i.e. matching of nested expressions,
normalisation, alias predicates, visualisation, etc. is kept in the
toplevel files named common_* and visualisation.[Ch].

To customize the generalized common code, replace ${DFI} with the type of
the carrier, that is with

  nnh99: o_ShapeGraphSetLifted
  srw98: o_ShapeGraphLifted

These replacements are done automatically by the Makefile.
