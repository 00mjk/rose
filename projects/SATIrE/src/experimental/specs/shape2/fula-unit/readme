how to create unit tests for fula code:

 - include the functions you want tested in <fula-includes.optla>
   with an #include "..."

 - create a file whose name begins with "test_"
   it has the following format:
    - first line, if it begins with a // comment
      acts as short description of the test.
      is displayed along with the results
    - the following lines are fula code that
      perform the actual test. the last expression
      returns true or false, depending on the
      success of the test.

 - if you want to disable some of the tests, rename
   the corresponding "test_*" files. only files that
   have a name starting with "test_" are included by
   the test driver.
