DEBIE-1 DPU SW BENCHMARK: ANALYSIS PROBLEMS

This text defines the analysis problems (tasks, questions, jobs) posed
by the DEBIE-1 benchmark within the WCET Tool Challenge 2008. Each
Challenge participant is invited to solve each problem, under the
conditions given for the problem, and report the answer (analysis
results) in the format suggested in this text.

For each problem, we define:

- The number and title of the problem.

- The subprogram (C function in the case of DEBIE-1) that is to
  be analysed for WCET bounds, execution flow constraints, or
  other properties.

- The parameters or inputs from other sources (eg. global data,
  memory-mapped I/O registers, or calls to I/O libraries) that the
  subprogram uses. This does not include statically allocated variables
  that are read but have no effect on the execution paths (on the
  source-code level, at least).

- The constraints that can be assumed to hold for the values of the
  parameters and other inputs. Note that these may allow "invalid"
  values if the subprogram under analysis is designed to handle such
  values.

- Any other constraints or assumptions to be made.

- The specific results to be reported.

Please also read the Terms Of Use for the DEBIE-1 DPU SW. The README
file in this folder may help you understand the structure of the DEBIE-1
benchmark.

For the DEBIE-1 benchmark, the analysis problems are directly related to
and grouped according to the thread to be analysed. The thread is one of
the three interrupt service routines or one of the three non-interrupt
tasks.

Notes on the Problems

Problems 4b, 4c, 4d can be analysed as one combined problem (union
of input constraints and other constraints), giving an upper bound
on the WCET for any of these problems.
