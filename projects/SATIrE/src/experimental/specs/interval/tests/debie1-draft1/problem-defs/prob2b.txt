PROBLEM 2b: TM interrupt handler, send internal time register

Rationale

   See Problem 2a for the general rationale.

   This problem addresses the special case for the TM ISR where the next
   transmitted word is the first word of the internal time clock, which
   means that internal time first has to be copied into the status
   registers, a slow action on the 80C32.

Subprogram

   TM_InterruptService

Inputs

   TC_state
      A global state variable.
      Has the value register_TM_e.

   telemetry_end_pointer
      Pointer to data memory (external memory, on the 8051).
      Any pointer value for readable (data) memory.

   telemetry_pointer
      Pointer to data memory (external memory, on the 8051).
      Has the value "(unsigned char *) &telemetry_data.time".
      Alternatively, this input-value condition can be replaced
      by the execution-path constraint stated below.

Other constraints

   The constraint, above, on the value of the "telemetry_pointer" input,
   can replaced by the constraint that the COPY macro is executed.

Path-analysis results to be reported
