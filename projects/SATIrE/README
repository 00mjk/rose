SATIrE: Static Analysis Tool Integration Engine

1)
run 'make' for compiling all SATIrE modules and analyzers (ROSE must be installed)
run 'make docs' for creating all documentation in 
    * 'docs' (pdf files) and 
    * 'src/grato/docs/html/index.html' (html documentation)
run 'make check' for running tests (PAG and ROSE, must be installed)
run 'make clean' for removing all generated files

2)
To install all satire files:
You must define the variable INSTALL_PREFIX 
- this variable is used to define INSTALL_INCLUDES, INSTALL_LIBS, INSTALL_BIN
  if you require to set each to a separate directory, you currently need to
  set it directly in src/Makfile
and run 'make install'

examples:
  INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/bin make install
  INSTALL_PREFIX=~/satire_install make install

Note, you must use an absolute path for INSTALL_PREFIX.

3)
Crafting an analysis:
  * ensure that <INSTALL_PREFIX>/bin is in your environment variable path.
  * ensure that the following environment variables are set
    ROSE_INCLUDE (the include directory of installed ROSE)
    ROSE_LIB (the lib directory of installed ROSE)
    PAGDIR (the directory of installed PAG)
    SATIRE_INCLUDE (the include directory of installed SATIRE)
    SATIRE_LIB (the lib directory of installed SATIRE)
  * run 'newanalysis <ANALYSIS_NAME> <CARRIER_TYPE>' to create an analysis of 
    name <ANALYSIS_NAME> with a carrier type <CARRIER_TYPE>
  * cd <ANALYSIS_NAME>
  * implement <ANALYSIS_NAME>.optla and <ANALYSIS_NAME>.set
  * run 'make' to compile your analyzer
  * run your analyzer '<ANALYSIS_NAME> <INPUTFILE>'. The input file is some
    C/C++ file and the executable analyzer is of name <ANALYSIS_NAME>.
    This will generate a file '<ANALYSIS_NAME>_result.gdl' which can be
    viewed with aiSee.
