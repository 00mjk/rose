SATIrE: Static Analysis Tool Integration Engine
------------------------------------------------------------

SATIrE integrates static analysis tools into existing compiler
infrastructures.  Curenlty the focus is on integration of AbsInt's
Program Analysis Generator (PAG) into infrastructures which offer an
abstract syntax tree. The infrastructure that is fully supported is
the C/C++ infrastructure LLNL-ROSE.

------------------------------------------------------------
(1) INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------

 a) Before you can install SATIrE
    i)  you must install LLNL-ROSE
    ii) you must install PAG

 b) After installation of LLNL-ROSE and PAG set the following 
    environment variables:

    - ROSE_INCLUDE (the include directory of installed LLNL-ROSE)
    - ROSE_LIB (the lib directory of installed LLNL-ROSE)
    - PAGDIR (the directory of installed PAG)

 c) Unpack the satire tar-ball with:
    tar xvzf satire_0.7.0

 d) Go to the satire directory:
    cd satire_0.7.0

 e) Perform the following operations with make:
    run 'make' for compiling all SATIrE modules and analyzers (ROSE must be installed)

    run 'make check' for running several tests (PAG and ROSE, must be installed)

    run 'INSTALL_PREFIX=<my_install_prefix> make install
        where <my_install_prefix> is your directory path in which the directories
        'include', 'lib', 'bin' will be created.

        examples:
          INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/ make install
          INSTALL_PREFIX=~/satire_install make install

        Note, you must use an absolute path for INSTALL_PREFIX!
    
    Now you are ready to specify, compile, and run an anlysis.

------------------------------------------------------------
(2) GETTING STARTED WITH AN ANALYSIS THAT COMES WITH SATIrE
------------------------------------------------------------

 a) Ensure that SATIrE's <INSTALL_PREFIX>/bin is in your environment variable path.

 b) Ensure that the following environment variables are set:
    ROSE_INCLUDE (the include directory of installed ROSE)
    ROSE_LIB (the lib directory of installed ROSE)
    PAGDIR (the directory of installed PAG)
    SATIRE_INCLUDE (the include directory of installed SATIRE)
    SATIRE_LIB (the lib directory of installed SATIRE)

 c) We chose the example sl1rd:
    [let's assume that you unpacked satire_0.7.0.tgz in your home directory]

    cp -r ~/satire_0.7.0/examples/sl1rd . [copy all files and test files to your directory]
    newanalysis sl1rd VarLabPairSetLifted [generate and configure all required files]
    cd sl1rd                              [change to the directory]
    make                                  [compile the analyzer (links ROSE,PAG,SATIrE files)]
    sl1rd tests/rdtest1.C                 [run the analyzer on the test file 'rdtest1.C']
    aisee sl1rd_result.gdl                [view the analysis result with aisee]
    

------------------------------------------------------------
(3) CRAFTING A NEW ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------------------------

 a) Ensure that <INSTALL_PREFIX>/bin is in your environment variable path.

 b) Ensure that the following environment variables are set:
    ROSE_INCLUDE (the include directory of installed ROSE)
    ROSE_LIB (the lib directory of installed ROSE)
    PAGDIR (the directory of installed PAG)
    SATIRE_INCLUDE (the include directory of installed SATIRE)
    SATIRE_LIB (the lib directory of installed SATIRE)

 c) Run 'newanalysis <ANALYSIS_NAME> <CARRIER_TYPE>' to create an analysis of 
    name <ANALYSIS_NAME> with a carrier type <CARRIER_TYPE>. This command
    creates a directory of name <ANALYSIS_NAME> and copies&configers several
    files into that directory.

 d) cd <ANALYSIS_NAME>

 e) Implement <ANALYSIS_NAME>.optla and <ANALYSIS_NAME>.set

 f) Run 'make' to compile your analyzer

 g) Run your analyzer '<ANALYSIS_NAME> <INPUTFILE>'. The input file is
    some C/C++ file and the executable analyzer has the name <ANALYSIS_NAME>.
    This will generate a file '<ANALYSIS_NAME>_result.gdl' which can be
    viewed with the tool aiSee.

    Note, the command 'newanalysis' never modifies *.set or *.optla files
    but does overwrite Makefile, main.C, main-support.C in the directory 
    <ANALYSIS_NAME>, according to the parameters of the command.
