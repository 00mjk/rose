PROBLEM 4b: TC Execution task, start TC buffering, MSB

Rationale

   For the general rationale see Problem 4a.

   This analysis problem addresses the special case when the SW starts
   to receive and buffer a multi-word TC. In this mode, the TC Execution
   task has a deadline of 10 ms.

   The main input is the TC command word that was received and accepted
   by the TC interrupt service routine. This input is set by the call of
   WaitMail at the start of HandleTelecommand. Two TCs can start a
   multi-word TC: the "write code memory" command (TC-code
   WRITE_CODE_MEMORY_MSB) and the "write data memory" command (TC-code
   WRITE_DATA_MEMORY_MSB).

Subprogram

   HandleTelecommand

Inputs

   GetMode
      A function that returns the master DEBIE mode.
      Any value in the return type. (Multi-word telecommands are
      accepted and executed only in the STAND_BY mode, but the 10 ms
      deadline applies for such TCs in other modes, too.)

   received_command.TC_word
      A statically allocated buffer for the received TC word.
      Undefined before the call of WaitMail; then a word that contains
      either WRITE_CODE_MEMORY_MSB or WRITE_DATA_MEMORY_MSB as the "TC
      code" part.

   TC_state
      A global state variable.
      Has the value tc_handling_e.

   TC_mail
      A statically allocated structure that holds status flags and a
      pointer to received_command.TC_word. The status flags are set by
      the call of WaitMail. Any values are possible.

Other constraints

   As in Problem 4b.
