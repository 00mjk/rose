PROBLEM 2a: TM interrupt handler, most common case

Rationale

   The TM ISR has a required deadline of 1 ms, and in fact its WCET must
   be considerably less because the interrupt can be repeated with the
   same period, 1 ms, and the ISR must not consume all of the CPU.

   This problem addresses the most common case for the TM ISR, which is
   to initiate the transmission of the next 16-bit word from the TM
   pointer and to advance that pointer, possibly with wrap-around in the
   case of "register TM" (cyclic transmission of the DEBIE status
   registers). Moreover, we exclude the special case where the next
   transmitted word is the first word of the internal time clock (in
   that case, the internal time first has to be copied into the status
   registers, a slow action on the 80C32).

Subprogram

   TM_InterruptService

Inputs

   TC_state
      A global state variable.
      Any value in the enumeration TC_state_t.

   telemetry_end_pointer
   telemetry_pointer
      Pointers to data memory (external memory, on the 8051).
      Any pointer value for readable (data) memory, but
      telemetry_pointer < telemetry_pointer.

Other constraints

   The (macro) statement COPY (telemetry_data.time, internal_time)
   is not executed.

Path-analysis results to be reported

   None.

WCET-analysis results to be reported

   WCET of TM_InterruptService
