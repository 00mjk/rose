PROBLEM 1: TC interrupt handler

Rationale

   The TC ISR has a required deadline of 1 ms.
   The ISR operates in roughly the same way in all DEBIE modes,
   but the details depend on the mode and on the TC that is
   received. However, one analysis is enough.

Subprogram

   TC_InterruptService

Inputs

   free_slot_index
      A statically allocated integer variable.
      A valid index to science_data.event[].

   READ_TC_LSB
      A macro that returns the lower 8 bits of the TC input register.
      Simulated; see harness.c.
      Any 8-bit value.

   READ_TC_MSB
      A macro that returns the lower 8 bits of the TC input register.
      Simulated; see harness.c.
      Any 8-bit value.

   TC_state
      A global state variable.
      Any value in the enumeration TC_state_t.

   TC_TIMER_OVERFLOW_FLAG
      A macro that returns the "overflow" flag of a timer
      that measures the time since the last TC interrupt was
      handled (this enforces a mininum interval on TCs).
      Simulated; see harness.c.
      Any value of its type.

   TC_look_up
      A global array, constant after initialization.
      See the values in InitTC_LookUp.

   telemetry_data.error_status
   telemetry_data.mode_status
      Components of a global state data structure.
      Any 8-bit value.

   telemetry_end_pointer
   telemetry_pointer
      Pointers to data memory (external memory, on the 8051).
      Any pointer value for readable (data) memory.

Other constraints

   The function InitTelecommandTask has been executed once before the
   first activation of TC_InterruptService. However, other functions,
   including other activations of TC_InterruptService, may have executed
   after InitTelecommandTask and before the activation, to be analysed,
   of TC_InterruptService.
