PROBLEM 2c: TM interrupt handler, end of TM

Rationale

   See Problem 2a for the general rationale.

   This problem addresses the special case for the TM ISR in which the
   ISR detects that the last word of a requested TM block has been
   transmitted, and TM should end. In this case, the ISR sends a message
   to the TC execution task, which takes some time and is not the common
   case.

Subprogram

   TM_InterruptService

Inputs

   TC_state
      A global state variable.
      Any value in the enumeration TC_state_t, except register_TM_e.
      Alternatively, this input-value condition can be replaced
      by the execution-path constraint stated below.

   telemetry_end_pointer
   telemetry_pointer
      Pointers to data memory (external memory, on the 8051).
      Any pointer value for readable (data) memory, but
      equal values: telemetry_pointer = telemetry_end_pointer.
      Alternatively, this input-value condition can be replaced
      by the execution-path constraint stated below.

Other constraints

   The constraints, above, on the values of the inputs, can be replaced
   by the constraint that the Send_ISR_Mail macro is executed (at least
   once).
