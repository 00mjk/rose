1) Temporary variables in expressions
   * x=y+f();
     a temporary variable is introduced in the expression. Therefore, even if
     an analysis does not modify the analysis information for expressions
     we may need to update it to remove temporary variables for such
     expressions. Clearly, this impacts how analysis are written.
