\section{Introduction}
This document describes an on-going project aimed at defining a compiler independent
runtime system for many-core optimization.  It is presently distributed as 
part of the ROSE compiler~\cite{roseWeb2008}, but nothing about it is dependent 
upon the ROSE compiler. It is also part of a few projects that are specific to 
Exascale research.

This document is not meant to reflect the final design or implementation choices.
