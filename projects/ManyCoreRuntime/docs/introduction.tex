\section{Introduction}
This document describes an on-going project aimed at defining a compiler independent
runtime system for many-core optimization.  It is presently distributed as 
part of the ROSE compiler~\cite{roseWeb2008}, but nothing about it is dependent 
upon the ROSE compiler. It is also part of a few projects that are specific to 
Exascale research.

This document is not meant to reflect the final design or implementation choices. 


This project represents a runtime system to support many core optimizations.

A specific focus is on exascale architectues and supporting manycore
processors that will have either no cross-chip cache coherency or 
poor performance of any possible cross-chip cache coherency.

As a model exascale machines we assume:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item A million processors (this runtime system is mostly independent of distributed
      memory processing).

   \item A thousand cores per processor (to be thought of as any combination of CPU cores
    or GPU cores).

   \item Zero cross-chip cache coherency.
\end{enumerate}


This work is a draft of an evlving many-core runtime system that will fit with 
other programming model building blocks.


A goal if for this work to be coupled with a compiler to support many-core
optimizations for HPC applications.  Stencil operations are a specific target.
