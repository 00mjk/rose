\begin{abstract}
\noindent CodeThorn is a tool for analyzing C/C++ programs by combining approaches
from data flow analysis, constraint-based analysis, and model
checking. The main focus in the development of CodeThorn is the
exploration of program analysis algorithms while combining above
approaches and to explore methods for combining static analysis with
methods for software verification.

The input language is currently restricted to a subset of C.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

CodeThorn was initially developed as a tool for exploring approaches
for reachbility analysis and verification of linear temporal logic (LTL)
formulae based on finite state systems~\cite{schordan2014combining}. 
This was later extended to
also perform specialization of programs and program equivalence
checking~\cite{schordan2014verification}. CodeThorn is based on the 
ROSE compiler infrastructure\footnote{\url{http://www.rosecompiler.org/}} 
and uses the ROSE abstract syntax tree as basis for its input. 
A number of components have been moved
from CodeThorn to ROSE over time. What remains are command line
options that allow to access those features conveniently and also to
reproduce some published results.

\subsection{Use in Competitions}

Since 2012, CodeThorn has been successfully used to participate in the
international RERS Challenge\footnote{\url{http://www.rers-challenge.org}} 
on program analysis and verification~\cite{schordan2014combining}.
Among other accomplishments, the use of CodeThorn helped to become overall winner and obtain the method
combination award in RERS 2014 as well as to win the 1st place in the Sequential LTL track of the 
recent 2017 iteration of RERS\footnote{See \url{http://www.rers-challenge.org} for detailed competition results}.
Participating in the challenge led to many improvements in the tool such as an efficient
parallelization of the analysis~\cite{jasper2016multi} and to the development of new model checking 
approaches~\cite{jasper2014counterexample}.

Starting in 2016, the LTL model checking infrastructure of CodeThorn has been successfully
applied to generate parallel verification benchmarks. These benchmarks were used for 
a new parallel track of the RERS Challenges 2016 and 2017~\cite{jasper2017rers}.


\subsection{Benchmarks}

We have found that benchmarks of the RERS Challenge
serve as an excellent guidance in crafting this tool and investigating
the impact and performance of each of the approaches on the overall
results. For the RERS programs, LTL formulae are
provided. This allows to verify behavioral properties of these
programs. Reachability properties can be verified by checking the
reachability of failing assertions.

For program equivalence checking and data race detection the
Polybench/C 3.2 suite has provided a good basis for evaluation. By
generating various polyhedral variants of the 30+ benchmarks, CodeThorn
can be used to check the equivalence of two given programs and verify
whether the optimizations are semantics preserving. 
Furthermore,
parallel OpenMP for loops are recognized and can be checked not to
introduce data races. Currently these approaches are extended to
address other large scale applications.

\section{Installation}

No additional configuration is required because
CodeThorn is configured as part of ROSE. In order to use all features of CodeThorn however,
the SPOT LTL model checking library version 1.2.6\footnote{This version of SPOT can be downloaded here: 
\url{https://www.lrde.epita.fr/dload/spot/spot-1.2.6.tar.gz}} is required. In addition, some
experimental features require the Z3 SMT 
solver\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3}}. Please provide the options
\verb+--with-spot=<spot-install-dir>+ and \verb+--with-z3=<z3-install-dir>+ to ROSE's configure command.

Run 'make', 'make install', and optionally 'make check' in the
\verb+projects/+ \verb+CodeThorn+ directory to install CodeThorn. CodeThorn is
installed as 'codethorn' (at the same location as other ROSE tools, in
the 'bin' directory of the ROSE installation).

\section{Command Line Options}

\subsection{Counterexample-Guided Prefix Refinement Analysis}
The Counterexample-guided prefix refinement analysis (CEGPRA)~\cite{jasper2014counterexample} is a special instance 
of CEGAR for reactive, PLC-like systems.
Based on an over-approximating initial model of the analyzed program's behavior, model checking is performed. In an iterative process, spurious counterexamples are removed by guided unrolling of the actual program's reachable state space. 
\begin{verbatim}
  --csv-stats-cegpra arg      output statistics regarding the 
                              counterexample-guided prefix refinement analysis

  --cegpra-ltl arg            Select the ID of an LTL property that should be 
                              checked using cegpra (between 0 and 99).
  --cegpra-ltl-all arg        Check all specified LTL properties using cegpra 
                              [=yes|no]
  --cegpra-max-iterations arg Select a maximum number of counterexamples 
                              anaylzed by cegpra (default: no limit).
  --viz-cegpra-detailed arg   generate visualization (.dot) output files with 
                              prefix <arg> for different stages within each 
                              loop of cegpra.

  --pattern-search-asserts arg     reads a .csv-file (one line per assertion, 
                                   e.g. "1,yes"). The pattern search terminates
                                   early if traces to all errors with "yes" 
                                   entries have been found. [=file-path]

\section{Analysis Overview}

The analysis is performed in five phases:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Syntactic and semantic analysis of the input program (ROSE). The program is analyzed and represented in memory as annotated abstract syntax tree (AST).
\item Control flow analysis. We compute a control flow graph (CFG) for the AST. Transitions, as computed for the state transition graph in the next phase, correspond to edges in the CFG.
\item Computation of the state transition system.
\item LTL checking. Input to the LTL checking phase are the state transition system and the LTL-formulae.
\item Reporting of analysis results. Reachability of failing assertions or verification errors is computed based 
on the transition system. Results for LTL formulae are computed solely by the LTL checker.
\end{enumerate}

States of the analyzed program are represented as follows:

\subsection{Program State}

A program state consists of a label (lab), a property state (pstate),
a constraint set (cset), an IO property (io). $PState = Var
\rightarrow Val$ where $Val$ is either a constant or $top$. $Val$ is a
lifted integer set. An execution state is defined as $EState = Lab \times
PState \times Constraints \times IO$ where $Constraints$ is a set of
constraints, and $IO$ determines whether one of the variables in $PState$ is
an input or output variable. More specifically, whether a variable is
read from stdin, or printed to stdout or stderr. Furthermore it
determines whether the state produces an output which is caused by a
failed assert.

\ignore{
Hence, the analysis information is represented as:

\begin{itemize}
\item Label: num
\item PState: VarId $\rightarrow$ Val
\item SState: Label $\times$ PStateId $\times$ ConstraintId $\times$ IOId
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IO Property - Input/Output and Exit Information}

This property represents the information that the operation is either
an input, an output, or a failed-assert operation. From the label and
the associated statement, details as relevant to reporting the
analysis results can be extracted. For example, in the RERS-problems
we find the information for a failed-assert by a) using the label to
find the corresponding statement and b) the associated C error label
is then found in a look-up operation on the ROSE AST.

\subsection{The State Transition System}

\newcommand{\deqop}[0]{\#\#}
\newcommand{\eq}[0]{=}

The State Transition System is represented as a graph where nodes
represent system states and edges represent the transition between two
states as computed by the evaluations of the respective transfer
function. They are therefore annotated with the respective statement
which has been analyzed by the transfer function.
