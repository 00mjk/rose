\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

CodeThorn is a tool for analyzing C/C++ programs, combining approaches
from data flow analysis, constraint-based analysis, and model
checking. The main focus in the development of CodeThorn is the
exploration of program analysis algorithms in combining above
approaches for its application in analyzing and optimizing
high-performance applications (HPC) and embedded systems
applications. When analyzing HPC applications one important aspect is
the analysis of parallelism in programs. For embedded systems timing
behaviour, e.g. wort-case execution time, is of equal
importance. Since processors, as they are used in embedded systems,
are becoming increasingly parallel, parallelism at the application
level is also becoming increasingly important. However, many HPC
applications are massively parallel and as such have no complicated
control structure, in difference to embedded systems control software
which usually shows complex control patterns which would not be
suitable for executing on massively parallel hardware (such as modern
GPUs).

CodeThorn has grown out of both those application areas, from
analyzing and optimizing source-to-source HPC applications \cite{MS-QSMK04CPA} with
ROSE-based tools \cite{ROSEWEBSITE,MS-SCAM05} and analysing embedded systems
software with SATIrE (which integrates ROSE and PAG \cite{PAG}) and
which has been applied in performing loop bound analysis (TuBound \cite{Prantl:SK08}, \cite{Kirner:SOSYM2010}) timiing
analysis (e.g. WCET challenge 2008/9 \cite{Prantl:WCET2009}).

Since verification of software is becoming increasingly important in
all areas where software analysis can be applied to aid the proper
development of software, we have recently begun the development of
CodeThorn to investige approaches that allow to combine approaches
from different areas and which may become suitable in different areas
of HPC and embedded systems.

We currently restrict the input language to a small subset of C as we
are also using it when normalizing compute intensive code for
optimizations. The RERS 2012 subset is therefore well suited for our
initial version. Future work will include porting our analyses from
SATIrE to CodeThorn (e.g. shape analysis \cite{shapeanalysis},
points-to analysis \cite{pointstoanalysis}, interval analysis \cite{intervalanalysis}).

In CodeThorn (in its present version 1.1) we integrate three approaches:

\begin{itemize}
\item Data-flow analysis (inter-procedural flow-senstive analysis, computing property states) 
\item Constraint-based analysis (extracting constraints from a given program and using those in narrowing down possible values of input variables on different branches)
\item Model checking (verifying LTLs using a state transition graph)
\end{itemize}

In the following sections we will describe briefly each approach and
how we combine them in analyzing the RERS challenge-problems. We have
found the RERS-challenge problems being an excellent guidence in
crafting this early version of the tool and investigating the impact
and performance of each of the approaches on the overall results, and
in particular the opportunities we see emerge and limitations we
currently face in respect to verfication. We believe that insights
gained in the work on the RERS challenge-problems will transfer to
analyses as we shall use them in above mentioned areas of HPC and
embedded systems.
