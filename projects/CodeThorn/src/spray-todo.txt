KNOWN BUGS:

Issue 1: SgSwithStatement is visited in transfer function. Possible reason: init is wrong.

TODO:

1) annotating analysis results

  1.2) annotate case properly (currently post-info intentionally not
       attached because a comment attached to a SgCaseOptionStmt is
       not unparsed after the case label by the ROSE unparser, but
       instead after the associated stmt (which is wrong).

  1.3) annotate functions properly (currently body is annotated for
       entry/exit)

2) icfg print
  2.1) case label only (without stmt)

3) add output of AST labeling to analyterix as new option.
