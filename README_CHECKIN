ROSE Check in procedure:

0) Make sure you are working with the latest update

1) ROSE/configure.in
   - modify version number (X.Y.ZZL)

2) make && make check && make dist && make distcheck && make install && make installcheck
   - must be run separately
   - must be run in that order
   - must pass without errors

3) ROSE/ChangeLog 
   a new entry has to include at least the following information:
   - new version number
   - who checked it in
   - comments on changes
   - run 'cvschk' in your ROSE directory.
     copy the output of 'cvschk' to the ChangeLog (except "Extra Files")
     (this includes all version numbers of tools used, etc.)

4) Send an e-mail to casc-rose@llnl.gov that you are checking in a new 
   version of ROSE. Include the new version number in this e-mail.

5) cvs commit -m "see ChangeLog".

6) check out a fresh version of ROSE in a new directory
   - run all tests as above, in part 2, on this checked-out version
   - make sure all tests succeed

7) cvs rtag ROSE-X-Y-ZZL ROSE
   - X-Y-ZZL has to be the same version number as in configure.in
     (X, Y, Z are numbers, L is a letter, note that here '-' is used instead
      of '.' as in configure.in)

8) send out e-mail that check-in was successful
   - copy & paste the output of make distcheck that the new version is ready
     for distribution in this e-mail.
   - include your new comments from the ChangeLog

regular definition of version number:
X=Y=Z=[0-9], L=[a-z]
X.Y.ZZL /* in configure.in */
X-Y-ZZL /* when using cvs rtag */

Note that in configure.in '.' is used to separate X,Y,ZZL where as with
etag '-' must be used, X-Y-ZZL!
